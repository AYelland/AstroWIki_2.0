## Pulsar Timing Arrays

> [!cian]
> Pulsar timing array: GWs produce correlated changes in pulse arrival times. Unlike LIGO need to account for gravitational wave perturbation both at the pulsar and the Earth. (?). Oh cuz We are not detecting with some detector like LIGO on Earth, we are deteching the GW strain on Earth itself, which changes the pulse arrival times at different telescopes. Maybe? Not sure.

The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) uses data, collected since 2005, from the Arecibo and  [[#GBT|Green Bank]] radio telescopes. Collaboration with goal to measure low-frequency gravitational wave universe through radio pulsar timing. 

#### InPTA

The Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA) uses the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope.

#### CPTA

The Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) uses the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST).

#### MPTA

- At 1.6 petabytes, it is the largest volume of astronomical data ever released.

#### Deep Space Network
NASA facility for the retrieval of signals from deep space telescopes. Consists of three facilities spaced equidistant from each other – approximately 120 degrees apart in longitude – around the world. These sites are near Goldstone, California; Madrid, Spain; and Canberra, Australia.

#### eRosita
Half of the data unavilable due to Russian invasion of Ukraine.

#### Lynx

#### Hitomi
#### KATRIN
*(**Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino Experiment**)*

- Wants to measure the mass of the electron antineutrino with sub-eV precision by examining the spectrum of electrons emitted from the beta decay of tritium. 

#### Voyager

- Two unmanned space missions, the probes Voyager 1 and Voyager 2
- Launched in 1977 to take advantage of a favorable alignment of the planets during the late 1970s
	- Voyager 1: *close fly-bys of Jupiter and Saturn*
	- Voyager 2: *close fly-bys of Jupiter and Saturn, in addition to Uranus and Neptune*
- Space probes were able to continue their mission into the outer solar system
	- Voyager 1 left [[Sun#Heliopause|heliopause]] in 2012
	- Voyager 2 left [[Sun#Heliopause|heliopause]] in 2018
	- Used to place limits interstellar environment beyond solar system
	- Voyager 1 is furthest manmade object from Earth
- Both Voyager missions are equipped with a Gold Record with the "Sounds of Earth" (similar to the [[Pioneer_plaque.svg|Pioneer Plaque]])

Major [[Instruments#LIGO]] Discoveries:

| Event    | Source                                                 | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GW150914 | [[Binary Stars\|Binary]] [[Black Hole]] Merger (BBH)   | [[Gravitational Waves#Chirp Mass]] ($M_{\rm c}$) $\sim 30 \, M_{\odot}$ which resulted in Nobel prize                                                                                           |
| GW170817 | [[Binary Stars\|Binary]] [[Neutron Star]] Merger (BNS) | First (and only) detection with EM follow-up by [[Instruments#Fermi]] that led to [[Gamma Ray Burst\|GRB]] detection.                                                                           |
| GW190521 | [[Binary Stars\|Binary]] [[Black Hole]] Merger (BBH)   | One of the progenitors ($\sim 85\,M_{\odot}$) and the [[Black Hole#Intermediate-Mass Black Hole\|IMBH]] remnant ($\sim 150\,M_\odot$) lay in the [[Black Hole#^mass-gap\|Pair Instability Gap]] |

- [[Instruments#LIGO]] Observing Runs:
	- O1 *(2015)*
		- GW150914
		- One other BBH detection
	- O2 *(late 2016 - 2017)*
		- $15-25\%$ sensitivity improvement
		- [[Instruments#VIRGO]] comes online
		- 2 [[Gravitational Waves|GW]] detections, including GW170817
	- O3 *(2019 - early 2020)*
		- More than 50 BBH mergers to date
		- One other BNS, but no EM follow-up
		- GW190521
		- Potential BNS detection?
		- [[Instruments#KAGRA]] comes online
	- O4 *(May 24, 2023 - current)*
		- Already double the number of detections just during this run, relative to all previous detections
		- Increased sensitivity came from injecting squeezed states into one of the detectors (lowers the photon shot noise)
		- Potential BNS merger detection?

- [[Instruments#VIRGO]] and [[Instruments#KAGRA]] work with [[Instruments#LIGO]] to form the LVK collaboration.

##### Future:

- Continued improvement of [[Instruments#LIGO]], [[Instruments#VIRGO]], and [[Instruments#KAGRA]] [[Gravitational Waves|GW]] observatories to build statistics and template generation
- [[Instruments#LISA]] is a future space-based triangular interferometer
	- will be more sensitive to extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and supermassive BH ([[Black Hole#Supermassive Black Hole|SMBH]]) mergers
- [[Instruments#Cosmic Explorer]] future ground-based interferometer with longer arms ($40\,\pu{km}$) that increase the GW sensitivity (sensitivity $\propto L^{2}$ , but diminishing returns since longer arms means not sensitive to high frequency waves) with no additional noise (ideally).

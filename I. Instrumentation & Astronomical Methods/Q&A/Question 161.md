##### What are the pros/cons of having a space-based versus ground-based observatory?

![[space_ground.png|align:center]]

##### At what wavelengths can you do both?

- Optical
- some NIR
- sub-mm
- radio (Some limitations here though, due to plasma frequency on ground and practicality in space. See [[Question 158]] and [[Question 93]])

##### At what wavelengths can you only observe from space?

- $\gamma$-ray
- X-ray
- UV
- most IR to a degree, mostly far-IR

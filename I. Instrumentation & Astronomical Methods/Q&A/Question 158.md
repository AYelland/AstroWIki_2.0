These wavelengths ($1 \; {\rm \mu m}$, $10 \; {\rm \mu m}$, $100 \; {\rm m}$) correspond to [[Electromagnetic Spectrum|Near-IR]], [[Electromagnetic Spectrum|Mid-IR]], and [[Electromagnetic Spectrum|Radio]].

- Near-IR (NIR)
	- *Wavelength: $1 \; {\rm \mu m}$*
	- Water absorbs strongly here, but can observe here at high altitudes where air is dry (or in desert, including poles). 
	- Atmospheric seeing limits resolution to $\theta_{\rm atm} = 0.5 \gg \theta_{\rm min}$ where the min is set by [[Question 156|diffraction limitation]] for a $10\,\pu{m}$ telescope, but can be overcome somewhat by [[Tools#Adaptive Optics|adaptive optics]].
- Mid-IR (MIR)
	- *Wavelength:* $10 \; {\rm \mu m}$
	- Absorbed by $\ce{CO_2}$ in the atmosphere
	- Very hard to do with ground-based observations
	- Space often necessary for mid-IR observations, where observations are only [[Question 156|diffraction-limited]].
- Radio
	- *Wavelength: $100 \; {\rm m}$
	- Far radio ($\gtrsim 10\,\pu{m}$) is absorbed by the ionosphere (related to [[Question 93|plasma frequency]]) so best to go to space. 
	- Resolution on earth is limited by this absorption, but in mid-radio are diffraction-limited (below $10\,\pu{m}$)

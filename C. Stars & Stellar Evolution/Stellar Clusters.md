[[#Open Cluster|Open clusters]] and [[#Globular Cluster|globular clusters]] form two distinct astrophysical systems that gravitationally bind stars together, outside of galaxies. The primary difference between the two clusters is the density of stars within the cluster and their age/composition.

## Cluster Evolution

The formation and evolution very similar between [[#Open Cluster|open clusters]] and [[#Globular Cluster#globular clusters]]. The difference between is that globular clusters formed long before the open clusters we see today. This accounts for the larger and older stellar population, provided there were large molecular clouds available during the globular cluster formation period. Later on, when the open clusters began forming, there simply wasn't enough gas remaining in the [[Interstellar Medium|ISM]] to accrete into larger structures.

**Stages of Cluster Life Cycles:**
- Collapse of part of a giant molecular cloud
	- Initial disruption causing the collapse can come from nearby supernova, collisions with other clouds, gravitational interactions, or unstable internal conditions
	- Sometimes, two or more separate open clusters to form out of the same molecular cloud
	- Two clusters born at the same time can form a binary cluster.
- Collapsing region will undergo hierarchical fragmentation into smaller clumps to form stars
	- Smaller clumps are known as *infrared dark clouds* due to only being observable in the infrared (the molecular cloud blocks other observations)
- The ionized gas is stripped from the cluster (over $\sim 10^{7} \; {\rm yr}$) from the newly formed stars and the internal supernovae
	-  [[Spectral Classes#O]][[Spectral Classes#B]] stars emit ultraviolet radiation steadily ionizes the surrounding gas forming an [[Interstellar Medium#HII Regions|HII region]] before push out the ionized gas through stellar winds and radiation pressure
	- The shocks from the core-collapse supernovae (after $\sim 10^{6} \; {\rm yr}$) will also expel gas
- No further star formation will take place
	- $\sim 50 \%$ of the resulting protostellar objects will be left surrounded by circumstellar disks or accretion disks
	- Only $\sim 30 - 40 \%$ of the gas in the cloud core forms stars, such that all clusters suffer significant infant weight loss as the gas is stripped
- Aging of the cluster
	- Stars progress on their evolutionary tracks
	- Potentially other clusters merge together, increasing the number of stars bound in the system
- The death of the cluster
	- The stripping away of molecular gas reduces the cluster mass enough to allow radial dispersal (not enough gravity for stars to remain bound)
	- Evaporation (gradual loss) through internal processes or external interactions
	- Could be ripped apart into *stellar streams* through major gravitational disruptions and merge with a larger system (i.e. galaxy)
	- Once stars become gravitationally unbound, cluster becomes a *stellar association*, *moving cluster*, or *moving group*

## Open Cluster

An **open cluster** is a group of $\sim 10 - 1000$ (loosely) [[Binding Energy#Gravitational Binding Energy|gravitationally bound]], young stars that formed from the same giant cloud of molecular gas such that have roughly the same age and composition. 

> [!measure] Typical Parameters
> - Mass Range: $\sim 50 - 100 \; {\rm M_{\odot}}$ 
> - Size Range: $\lt 10 \; {\rm pc}$ 
> - Density: $\sim 1.5 \; {\rm star/ly^{3}}$ 

#### Characteristics

- An inherently unstable system
	- The escape velocity of the system tends to be lower than the average velocity of the constituent stars
	- When an open cluster has close encounters with other clusters, clouds of gas, or other massive objects during their orbit (about the [[Anatomy of a Galaxy#Galactic Center]]), they can be stripped of their cluster members, gas, and in extreme encounters fully disrupted into streams
- Only observed in [[Galaxy Classification#Spiral Galaxy|spiral]] and [[Galaxy Classification#Irregular Galaxy|irregular]] galaxies with active star formation (thus far)
- Filled with young, blue stars
	- The cluster tend to be dispersed before most of their stars reach the end of their lives
- Unexplained higher population of [[Stellar Classes#Blue Straggler|Blue Stragglers]] 

## Globular Cluster

A **globular cluster** is a group of $\sim 10^{3} - 10^{6}$ (tightly) [[Binding Energy#Gravitational Binding Energy|gravitationally bound]], *old* stars that have roughly the same age and composition. These clusters are much bigger and denser than [[#Open Cluster|open clusters]].

> [!measure] Typical Parameters
> - Mass Range: $\sim 10^{3} - 10^{6} \; {\rm M_{\odot}}$ 
> - Size Range: $\sim 3 - 100 \; {\rm pc}$ 
> - Density: $\sim 2 \; {\rm star/ly^{3}}$ 
> - Average Luminosity: $\sim 25000 \; {\rm L_{\odot}}$

#### Characteristics

- Significantly older stellar population ([[Stellar Populations#Population II (Pop. II)]])
	- No [[Spectral Classes#O]][[Spectral Classes#B]][[Spectral Classes#A]][[Spectral Classes#F]] main sequence stars
	- Many stars in evolutionary stages after [[Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram#Terminal-Age Main Sequence (TAMS)|main sequence turn-off]] ([[Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram#Red Giant Branch (RGB)|RGB]], [[Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram#Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)|AGB]], [[Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram#Horizontal Branch]])
- There is a higher density of stars than in [[Interstellar Medium|ISM]] or [[#Open Cluster|Open Clusters]] peaking towards the center
	- If we were able to draw a sphere just large enough to contain the Sun and Proxima Centauri, this same sphere in the center of the globular cluster (M13), it would contain approximately 10,000 stars.
- The stellar dynamical interactions are more common, producing higher numbers of [[Binary Stars#X-Ray Binary|XRBs]] and [[Binary Stars#Cataclysmic Variables (CVs)|CVs]] (per unit mass).
- Do not contain any gas and are not associated with reflection or emission nebulae
- More isotropically distributed across the sky

> [!space] Globular Cluster vs Dwarf Galaxy
> Globular clusters are similar to a dwarf galaxy in mass, but are significantly more compact, causing them to be more luminous. Additionally, they are thought to have a lower dark matter content relative to dwarf galaxies, forcing the stars to be closer together to remain gravitationally bound.
> $$R_{\rm glob} \sim \mathcal{O}(10 \; {\rm pc}) \hspace{2cm} R_{\rm dwarf} \sim \mathcal{O}(100 \; {\rm pc})$$

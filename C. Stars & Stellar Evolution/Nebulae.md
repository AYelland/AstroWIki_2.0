## Nebula

A nebula is a distinct luminescent part of interstellar medium where gas, dust, and other materials "clump" together to form a relatively denser region. These regions tend to be star-forming regions.

**Consist of**: 
- [[Interstellar Medium#Ionized Hydrogen|ionized]], [[Interstellar Medium#Atomic Hydrogen|neutral]] or [[Interstellar Medium#Molecular Hydrogen|molecular]] hydrogen
- cosmic [[Interstellar Medium#Dust|dust]]
- Particle density ~$10^{4}\,\pu{cm^{-3}}$ (Earth at sea level has ~$10^{19}\,\pu{cm^{-3}}$)

**Examples**:
- Eagle Nebula (star-forming Pillars of Creation within)
- Crab Nebula
- Orion Nebula (brightest nebula)
- Carina Nebula

## Emission Nebula

Circumstellar junk. A [[#Nebula|nebula]] formed of ionized gas emitting in various wavelengths. The most common source of ionization is high-energy ultraviolet photons emitted from a nearby hot star. 

**Types**:
- H II regions, in which star formation is taking place and young, massive stars are the source of the ionizing photons
- [[#Planetary nebula|Planetary nebulae]]


## Planetary Nebula

A **planetary nebula** is an [[Nebulae#Emission Nebula|emission nebula]] created from the irradiated outer layers of a dying, intermediate mass star  ($0.8 M_\odot \lesssim M \lesssim 8 M_\odot$) along the [[Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram#Post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (Post-AGB)|post-AGB track]]

> [!measure] Typical Parameters
> - Diameter: $\sim 0.3 \; {\rm pc}$
> - Particle Density: $10^{2} - 10^{4} \; {\rm cm^{-3}}$ *(decreases over expansion)*
> - Mass: $0.1 - 1 \; {\rm M_{\odot}}$

**Formation:**
- During the [[Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram#Post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (Post-AGB)|post-AGB]] track, the outer layers of the stellar envelope are radiated away through strong stellar winds from the hot [[Stellar Classes#White Dwarf|white dwarf]] core.
- This creates a distinct, denser cloud in the [[Interstellar Medium|interstellar medium]].
- Once ejected, the medium is irradiated with strong [[Electromagnetic Spectrum|UV]] radiation, ionizing the gas (sometimes, into a HII region).
	- $T_{\rm remnant} \sim 3 \times 10^{4} \; {\rm K}$
	- The ionized gas can then recombine, de-excite, and emit spectra that we observe
- The shape of the nebula can be spherical ($\sim20\%$) or have more complex morphologies ([[Stellar Classes#Bipolar Flows]], multipolar structures, etc.)

**Example:** Southern Ring Nebula

> [!note] Historical Note
> A **planetary nebula** is not actually associated with planetary bodies. They are named this because in the 19th century astronomers had low-resolution telescopes, and they thought these spherical gas clouds looked like gas planets at the time.

## Reflection Nebula

![[reflectionNebula.jpg|align:center|300]]

Clouds of [[Interstellar Medium#Dust|interstellar dust]] which reflect the light of a nearby star, in which the energy of the light is insufficient to ionize the material and create an [[#Emission nebula|emission nebula]], so the light is instead scattered by the dust, making it visible. Shown is [[Catalogs#IC|IC]] 2631


## Dark Nebula

A [[Interstellar Medium#Molecular Clouds|molecular cloud]] for which enough [[Interstellar Medium#Dust|dust]] is present and the medium is dense enough to block visible light from background sources like stars, [[Nebulae#Emission nebula|emission nebulae]] or [[Nebulae#Reflection nebula|reflection nebulae]].

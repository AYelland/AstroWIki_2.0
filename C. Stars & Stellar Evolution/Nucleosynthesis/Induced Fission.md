A type radioactive decay that only occurs when atomic nucleus is bombarded with an inciting particle (neutrons, gamma rays, or other carriers of energy) causing the nucleus to split into two or more lighter nuclei.

For heavy nuclides, this is an exothermic reaction that releases large amounts of energy through electromagnetic radiation and the kinetic energy of the lighter, resultant nuclei. 

> [!note] Energy Production
> For nuclear fission to produce energy, the total binding energy of the resulting elements must be greater than that of the starting element.

A type of radioactive decay in which one or more neutrons are ejected from a nucleus. 

Neutron emission can occur in:
- Neutron-rich/proton-deficient nuclides *(**spontaneous neutron emission**)*
- The excited states of a nucleus, through the processes:
	- ***photoneutron emission***- ejection a neutron from a nucleus by [[Gamma Decay]]
	- ***beta-delayed neutron emission*** - ejection a neutron from a nucleus following a [[Beta Decay]] reaction

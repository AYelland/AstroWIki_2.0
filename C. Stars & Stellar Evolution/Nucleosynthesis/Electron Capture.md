Electron Capture is a process in which an unstable nucleus ($\ce{^{A}_{Z}X}$) attracts and captures one of its atomic electrons ($e^{-}$), which then initiates the transformation of a proton ($p$) to a neutron ($n$) and the emission of an electron neutrino ($\nu_{e}$).

> One might expect after looking at [[Beta Decay#Beta-Minus Decay]], [[Beta Decay#Beta-Plus Decay]], and [[Electron Capture]] that there would also be process for **positron capture**; however, this is not true. The *"capture"* part in electron-capture refers to the fact that the electron is taken from its atomic orbit around the nucleus, containing the proton for the reaction. Since a positron cannot exist in a bound state with a nucleus, it can't be captured.

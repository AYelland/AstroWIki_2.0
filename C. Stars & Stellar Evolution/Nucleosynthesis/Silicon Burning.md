**Silicon burning** occurs in stars with $M \gtrsim 8 \; {\rm M_{\odot}}$ when gravitational contractions raises the star's core temperature to $2.7 - 3.5 \; {\rm GK}$.
- It is the final stage of fusion for massive stars, following the previous burning processes of hydrogen, helium, carbon, neon and oxygen.
	- After a star completes the oxygen-burning process, its core is composed primarily of silicon and sulfur.
	- At this temperature, some nuclei will undergo [[Photodisintegration|photodisintegration]], releasing all types of particles, including protons and alpha particles
	- The silicon will use the alpha particles in [[Alpha Process|alpha process]] to create heavier elements upto iron ($\ce{Fe}$)
- When a star has completed the silicon-burning phase, no further fusion is possible. 
- The star catastrophically collapses and explodes in a [[Stellar Explosions#Type II]] supernova.

A rare type of radioactive decay in which a proton is ejected from a nucleus. 

Proton emission can occur in:
- Proton-rich/neutron-deficient nuclei *(**spontaneous proton emission**, similar to [[Alpha Decay]])*
- The excited states of a nucleus, through the processes:
	- ***beta-delayed proton emission*** - ejection a proton from a nucleus following a [[Beta Decay]] reaction

For a proton to escape a nucleus, the proton separation energy must be negative such that the proton is therefore unbound, and tunnels out of the nucleus. 

> [!note] Not Naturally Occurring

> Proton emission is not seen in naturally occurring isotopes; proton emitters can be produced via nuclear reactions, usually using linear particle accelerators.

> - [[#Population III (Pop. III)]] - Original stars (very low metal content)

## Population I (Pop. I)

- Bluer stars
- Metal-rich *(i.e. young stars)*
- Often found in spiral arms of a galaxy (since these are star-forming regions)
- Usually maintain elliptical orbits about the galactic center
- Thought to have formed recently from enriched ISM
- Planets?
	- Theoretically: 
		- Pop. I stars are more likely have planetary systems, given planets are formed by the accretion metals
	- Observationally: 
		- [[Planetary Classes#Rocky Planets]] are concentrated about stars with a larger range of metallicities.
		- [[Planetary Classes#Gas Giants]] are concentrated around stars with relatively higher metallicity.

**Examples:** [[Sun]], stars in spiral arms and disk (star-forming regions)

## Population II (Pop. II)

- Yellow Stars
- Metal-poor *(i.e. old stars, stars formed in an unenriched medium with few metals)*
- Typically found near the central galactic bulge and within globular star clusters.
- Potentially higher ratio of "alpha elements" (elements produced by theÂ [[alpha process]]) compared to [[#Population I (Pop. I)|Pop I stars]], due to type II supernova contributions to the ISM at time of formation
- Orbits undergo random motion
- Thought to have formed from more pristine gas (i.e. hydrogen & helium based) before being enriched with metals from supernovae

**Examples:** stars near/in the [[Anatomy of a Galaxy#Galactic Bulge]], a [[Stellar Clusters#Globular Cluster]], or the [[Anatomy of a Galaxy#Stellar Halo]] 

## Population III (Pop. III)

- Theorized population of very first stars which formed when there were no metals at all ($z\simeq 20$)
- Extremely massive and luminous
- Not yet observed. Why?
	-  Too hard to image a star at such a high redshift (best change is lucky highly-magnified star via [[Gravitational Lensing]])
	- Initial mass function for stars would have been high-mass skewed (why?) and thus most of these stars would have died by now.
	- Observable ones could also have been enriched by metals from their environment at this point.

**Examples:** nowhere ($z \gtrsim 20$)

How does the CNO cycle work?

### Answer
---
The [[carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle]] (CNO cycle) is one of two known sets of nuclear fusion reactions that converts hydrogen to helium in stars. Similar to the [[Proton-Proton Chain]], it effectively converts four protons into one helium-4 nuclei, but it uses $\ce{C}$, $\ce{N}$, $\ce{O}$, and $\ce{F}$ in a catalytic manner to do so.

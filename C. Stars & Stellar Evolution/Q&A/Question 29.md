### Question
---
Two stars are observed to have the same color and brightness. One of them is a giant at a greater distance than the other, which is a main sequence star. How could these be distinguished from spectroscopic measurements?

### Answer
---
If two stars are observed have the same color (surface temperature, $T_{\rm eff}$) and the same brightness ([[Magnitude#Apparent Magnitude|apparent magnitude]]), then we cannot distinguish them through the [[Spectral Classes#Harvard Spectral Classification Scheme]] alone - regardless of their distance away from the observer. Because of this, we would classify the luminous, distant star (giant) and dim, nearby star (MS) as the same type of object.

To distinguish further, we need to know the luminosity. Therefore, enter the [[Luminosity Classes#Morgan-Keenan Luminosity Classification Scheme]]. 

By getting estimates for the radius of the star from the spectral line broadening and knowing the temperature, we can estimate the luminosity ($L = 4 \pi R^{2} \sigma T^{4}$).

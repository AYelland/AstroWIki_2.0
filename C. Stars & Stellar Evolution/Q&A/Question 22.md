### Question
---
Describe the various evolutionary phases of a low-mass $(1 \; {\rm M_{\odot}})$ star and those of a high-mass $(12 \; {\rm M_{\odot}})$ star. Show the corresponding evolutionary tracks on an HR diagram.

### Answer
---
Here is a visual for the life cycles of stars with various initial masses ([[Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram#Zero-Age Main Sequence (ZAMS)|ZAMS]] masses). The exact connection between the phases and stellar masses in the image below is loose.

Maybe a more helpful diagram is the [[Mass Cut Diagram]] that directly correlates the initial masses to some major evolutionary phases.

> All stars exhibit a common beginning, wherein a molecular cloud collapses if is larger than the [[Jeans Formalism#Jeans Mass]] (or smaller than the [[Jeans Formalism#Jeans Length]]). The mass of the initial molecular cloud and following protostar determine the rate of how fast it progresses through the [[Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram#Pre-Main Sequence]] and where it begins on the [[Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram#Main Sequence (MS)|Main Sequence Line]].

A summary of the stellar phases is shown below, where evolution takes place from top to bottom.

In the HR diagram above, the elements on the left represent what is currently being burned in the core, and each lobe represents the equivalent [[Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram#Subgiant Branch (SGB)|SGB]]-[[Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram#Red Giant Branch (RGB)|RGB]]-[[Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram#Helium Flash]]-[[Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram#Horizontal Branch]] evolution. This cycle of nuclear burning in the core and shells can be represented via the diagram below.

Though the evolutionary mechanics are very similar between low-mass and high-mass stars, there are some distinct differences throughout their evolutionary tracks.
- Stars with masses $\gtrsim 8 \; M_{\odot}$ will follow the [[Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram#Heavier-Element Burning]] processes after the helium fusion (Remember, no helium flash)
	- Maximum fusible element is iron ($\ce{Fe}$)
	- At end-of-life, iron core will only be stabilized by neutron degeneracy pressure, leading to a neutron star or black hole
- Massive stars are [[Luminosity#Eddington Limit|Eddington Limited]], such that $L \sim$ constant throughout evolution (above drawing maybe misleading)
- Strong stellar winds drive significant mass loss throughout the entire evolutionary track, not just after the [[Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram#Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)|AGB branch]]

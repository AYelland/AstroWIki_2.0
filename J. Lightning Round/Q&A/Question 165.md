What are the strongest spectral lines seen in each of the following: Integrated light from a typical galaxy, a quasar, a 100 km/s interstellar shockwave, a giant molecular cloud?

### Answer
---
##### (i) Galaxy
- Continuum Spectrum is approximately flat from combined [[Blackbody Radiation|blackbody radiation]] from many stars
- In [[Galaxy Classification#Elliptical Galaxy|elliptical galaxies]], we see 
	- Little star formation $\implies$ no strong emission lines
	- Metal absorption lines like $\ce{Ca,K,Mg}$ ($\sim 4000 \; \AA$)
- In [[Galaxy Classification#Spiral Galaxy|spiral galaxies]], we see
	- Ongoing star formation ionizes the gas, allowing it to produce emission lines
	- Most prominent are $\ce{H\alpha}$ ($\sim 6500 \; \AA$) and $\ce{O\,III}$ ($\sim 3700 \; \AA$) 

##### (ii) Quasar

- Ionizing radiation from the central source (from accretion power)
- More energy than stellar ionization, so see lines of higher ionization levels
- Strongest lines $\ce{Ly\alpha}$ ($\sim 1200 \; \AA$) and ionized ~low elements on periodic table like $\ce{C\,IV}$ ($\sim 1500 \; \AA$) and $\ce{OIII}$ 
- Also see Balmer lines, and we can use line ratios to determine the ionizing source

##### (iii) 100 km/s Interstellar Shockwave

- Produced by supernovae (see [[Question 51]]). 
- The gas temperature at this speed tells us that we can ionize helium, such that we see their strong spectral lines. $$E = \frac{1}{2} m v^{2} = \frac{3}{2} k_{\rm B} T \hRightarrow T \simeq (35 \; {\rm eV}) > (25 \; {\rm eV}) \simeq \chi_{\ce{He}}$$

##### (iv) Giant Molecular Cloud

- A molecular cloud is cold ($T\simeq 10$s of $\pu{K}$) so no ionization & lots of molecular gas
- Instead see rotational and vibrational molecule transitions. 
	- Strongest lines from $\ce{CO}$. 
	- Theres only 1 or those for every $10^4\,\ce{H_2}$, but unfortunately $\ce{H_2}$ is symmetric so no rotational modes, and lightweight so vibrational modes hard to observe.
	- Thus, we use $\ce{CO}$ as a tracer.

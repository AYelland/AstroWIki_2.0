> [!key-idea]
> The orbital resonance between astrophysical bodies occurs through the transfer of angular momentum of bodies in elliptical orbits. As two bodies orbit a single mass, they will drift toward a synchronized, stabled, equilibrium orbits with integer period-ratio values.
> 
> *(This is with the assumption that the restoring force from generated by the gravitational attraction between the two orbiting bodies is stronger than the gravitational force of the tidal effect of the central body.)*

It provides a very good explanation of **mean orbital resonance** using Jupiter's moons, Saturn's rings, the asteroid belt, and various exoplanet systems.

> *"Because Mimas is shifting those rocks around in their orbit to line them up with that symmetry line, they're moving through this crowded neighborhood. They're colliding with other rocks and its through those collisions that are knowing them out and leaving that area empty."*

> The explanation for this might be because Saturn's moon (Mimas) encourages more objects into that radius, increasing collision rates, and sending objects off into **perturbed, unstable orbits**? Therefore, some objects exist in the gap of the rings; however, they are regularly being get kicked out through other mechanisms besides orbital resonance. (unsure on this point.)

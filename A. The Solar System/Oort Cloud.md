## Oort Cloud

The **Oort Cloud** is distribution of [[Smaller Non-Planetary Bodies#Comet|comet]] nuclei stretching from beyond the [[Kuiper Belt]] subdivided into an inner [torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus "Torus")-shape with a radius of $\sim 1,000 - 10,000\;{\rm AU}$ and an outer spherical shell with a radius of $\sim 10,000 - 100,000\;{\rm AU}$.

> [!key-idea] **Important Characteristics:**
> - Assumed no consistent velocity distribution or inclination in the orbits, contributing the the "cloud" structure
> - Provides the source of long period comets in the solar system ($P > 200 \; {\rm yr}$)
> - Formed from [[Planetary Migration#Planetesimal-Driven Migration]] (using icy [[Smaller Non-Planetary Bodies#Planetesimals|planetesimals]]) during [[Standard Model of Planetary Formation|Planetary Formation]].
	> - Planets (mostly Jupiter) flung them out of the solar system, but not far enough to escape the Sun's gravitational attraction.
	> - The settled in the borderlands of the solar system, where the planets couldn’t perturb them anymore.
	> - Some of the captured bodies in the Oort cloud may not originate from our solar system, but its thought that majority come from [[Planetary Migration#Planetesimal-Driven Migration]]
> - Some orbits have very high inclinations, and this could be caused by their initial scattering, galactic tides, or perturbations with other nearby stars.

## Planetesimals

A primitive body composed of loose conglomerates of materials (dust, ice, gas) orbiting in a protoplanetary disk. They eventually grow into kilometre-scale bodies ($\sim 10 \, {\rm km}$) that will combine together to form of the foundation for planetary bodies.

## Asteroid

A small, rocky or metallic object ([[#planetesimals|planetesmial]]) that has survived planetary accretion.
- They tend to be round and/or elongated.
- They can have satellites (smaller gravitationally bound objects).
- They are parent bodies of [[#Meteoriod|meteoroids]].

When seen in a telescope, asteroids appear as a points of light. Most are found in a ring between the orbit of Mars and Jupiter called the asteroid belt.

> [!info] Types of Asteroids
> - *"NEA"* - Near-Earth Asteroid
> - *"C-type"* - An asteroid made of material that has largely been unmodified since the formation of the Solar System; the most primitive type of asteroid.
> - *"S-type"* - An asteroid made of material that has been modified from its original state, likely as the outer part of a larger, differentiated body that has since broken into pieces.
> - *"M-type"* - An asteroid that was once part of the metallic core of a larger, differentiated body that has since been broken into pieces; made mostly of iron and nickel.

## Comet

A more complex object consisting of dust, rock, and ices; however, it has a significantly large composition of ice than an [[#asteroid]].
- Has small, solid, icy nucleus.
- When a comet gets close to a star, its ice and dust content start to vaporize, creating an atmospheric halo and a tail of gas and dust.
	- When frozen, the solid spans a few miles to tens of miles in size.
	- When heated, the head of the comet can be larger than a planet and the tail stretches for millions of miles.
- The period of an orbit is considered *short* if $P < 200 \, {\rm yr}$. Similarly, the period is *long* if $P > 200 \, {\rm yr}$.

When seen in a telescope, a comet appears fuzzy and/or has a tail.

## Meteoroid

A small piece of interplanetary debris, usually a piece of [[#asteroid]] or a [[#comet]].
- Typically pebble-sized, but can be larger ($100 \, {\rm \mu m}  - 100 \, {\rm m}$).
- Often created from a collision.
- When a meteoroid enters a planet's atmosphere, it becomes a [[#meteor]].
- If the [[#meteor]] doesn't burn up in the atmosphere and it lands on the surface, it becomes a [[#Meteorite]].

## Meteor

A [[#meteoroid]] that has entered a planet's atmosphere at a very high speed and leaves an incandescent trail. 
- It is likely to burn up in the atmosphere and produces a streak of light. These are commonly observed as *shooting stars*.

> [!info] Types of Meteors
> - *"sporadic meteor"* - A meteor that is not associated with a specific meteor shower.
> - *"bolide"* - A very bright, exploding meteor.		
> - *"meteor shower"* - A larger-than-normal display of meteors, occurring when Earth passes through the orbit of a disintegrating comet, sweeping up its debris. (examples: Perseids, Leonids)
> - *"radiant"* - The direction in the sky from which the meteors in a meteor shower seem to come.

## Meteorite

A [[#meteor]] that survives the atmospheric burning and lands on the planet's surface.

> [!info] Categories of Meteorites
> 1. *"stony meteorite"* - A meteorite composed primarily of silicate minerals, similar to those found on Earth.
> 	- *"chondrite"* - A stony meteorite containing chondrules
> 	- *"achondrite"* - A stony meteorite that does not contain chondrules.
> 2. *"iron meteorite"* - A metallic meteorite composed mostly of iron-nickel alloys.
> 3. *"stony-iron meteorite"* - A meteorite consisting of a mixture of silicate minerals and iron-nickel alloys.

> [!note]  
> A *"chondrule"* is a small, crystallized, spherical inclusions of rapidly cooled molten droplets found in some meteorites.

## Trans-Neptunian ObjectÂ (TNO)

A trans-Neptunian object (TNO) is any minor planet in the Solar System that orbits the Sun at a greater average distance than Neptune, which has an orbital semi-major axis of $30.1 \, {\rm AU}$.

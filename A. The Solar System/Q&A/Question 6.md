### Question
---
Explain why solar system bodies are often found with integer ratios of orbital periods.

### Answer
---
In physics, when integers appear where we don't expect them, they tend to come from...
- Quantum Effects
- Symmetries
- Resonances

For the orbits or solar system bodies, the [[Orbital Resonance|mean-motion resonance]] (or orbital resonance) is the primary contributor. When multiple objects orbit a common, larger object, the orbits of the smaller bodies tend to gravitationally affect each other until they settle into stable equilibrium of integer-orbit-ratios. 

For 3-body orbiting systems, a specific type of [[Orbital Resonance|mean-motion resonance]] appears called **Laplace Resonance** with the 1:2:4 period ratio. Systems with this resonance ratio are called "Lapce-like" or "Laplace-type".

**Examples in the Solar System:**
- [[Kuiper Belt]] resonances with Neptune (including Pluto-Neptune at the 2:3 ratio)
- The [[Asteroid Belt]] resonance gaps with Jupiter ([[Asteroid Belt#Kirkwood Gaps]])
- Gaps in the Rings of Saturn from its Moons
- 2:4 - Tethys : Mimas (Saturn's Moons)
- 1:2 - Dion : Enceladus (Saturn's Moons)
- 3:4 - Hyperion : Titan (Saturn's Moons)
- 1:2:4 - Ganymede : Europa : Io (Jupiter's Moons)

##### Describe, qualitatively, the standard model for the formation of the solar system.

Through radioactive dating of heavy elements in meteorites, we have found that Solar System formed ~$4.5\,\pu{Gyr}$ ago.

Using the [[Standard Model of Planetary Formation]], we predict the Solar System underwent the following steps:

**Contraction:**
1. A rotating, gaseous nebula underwent gravitational collapse.
	- Through conservation of momentum, this formed a hot, dense [[Stellar Classes#Protostar|protostar]] in the center of the cloud and a flat, spinning accretion disk around it, called the protoplanetary disk. *(radius of cloud decreases, gas spins up $\Rightarrow$ accretion disk)*
2. The protostellar wind from the protostar increases the temperature of the inner parts of the accretion disk, sorting the materials in the different regions of the protoplanetary disk.
	- [[Standard Model of Planetary Formation#^ice-line|Ice Lines]] begin forming the disk for each chemical element and compound, based on its vaporization temperature.

**Ignition:**
3. When the pressure and temperature is high enough, the protostar will undergo thermonuclear ignition and begin burning hydrogen. However, this doesn't necessarily occur before the clumping process.

**Clumping:**
- Planets
	4. The rotating material (rocks, dust, ice, gas, etc.) begins clumping together in the accretion disk through electrostatic forces, creating [[Smaller Non-Planetary Bodies#Planetesimals|planetesimals]] of various compositions.
		- For $R < R_{\rm ice}$, the [[Smaller Non-Planetary Bodies#Planetesimals|planetesimals]] are composed of *rocky* material and later form [[Planetary Classes#Rocky Planets]]. Due to the high temperatures and stellar winds, they are unable to form any gaseous envelopes. (i.e. Venus, Mercury, Mars, Earth)
		- For $R > R_{\rm ice}$, the [[Smaller Non-Planetary Bodies#Planetesimals|planetesimals]] that are mostly composed of *rocky* material and later form [[Planetary Classes#Gas Giants]]. They grow to be much larger sizes due the abundance of available of material further away from the [[Stellar Classes#Protostar|protostar]]. Once the [[Smaller Non-Planetary Bodies#Planetesimals|planetesimals]] are large enough, gravitational forces pull in the nearby hydrogen and helium and create large gaseous envelopes. (i.e. Jupiter and Saturn)
			- If the gas envelope is not primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, and instead, it is composed of other ices (oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, etc.), then the resulting planet is considered a [[Planetary Classes#Ice Giants|Ice Giant]] (i.e. Uranus and Neptune)
- Moons
	5. Once the planetary bodies are mostly formed, they develop their own accretion disk that later go through a similar clumping process and creates their respective moons.
- [[Smaller Non-Planetary Bodies]]
	6. Material not drawn into the formation of planets and moons remained as smaller astronomical bodies within the system.

**Migration:**
7. Orbiting objects drift toward or away from the host star due to non-Keplerian orbits, caused by the pressure gradient of gas distribution in the accretion disk.
	- More specifically, tidal forces with the other planetary bodies and vicious interactions the accretion disk material are primary contributors to the migration. *(See [[Planetary Migration]] for specific processes)*
	- *Example:* Jupiter drifted closer to the [[Standard Model of Planetary Formation#^ice-line|ice line]] while the other giant planets migrated outward. We expect this because the disk density needed to be higher for the giant planets' formation. *(See [Grand Tack Hypostheis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_tack_hypothesis)*) Its also theorized that Neptune and Uranus switched positions at some point during this migration.
8. The remanent material ([[Smaller Non-Planetary Bodies]]) then cratered the planets and moons, if it wasn't trapped in the [[Asteroid Belt]], ejected from the inner solar system to the [[Kuiper Belt]] and the [[Oort Cloud]] *(See [[Question 5]])*, or put into its own Keplerian orbit.

##### Discuss observational evidence for this model. 

- Locations of rocky planets, gas giants and ice giants within solar system
- Heavy cratering from rocky and icy bodies within the solar system, alongside the existence of water on the [[Planetary Classes#Rocky Planets]].
	- This could only occur if the impact of the [[Smaller Non-Planetary Bodies]] was after the planets had already formed. Therefore, it is provides evidence of migration through [[Planetary Migration#Planetesimal-Driven Migration]] and [[Planetary Migration#Gravitational Scattering]].
- All planets roughly in ecliptic plane (i.e. they formed from same protoplanetary disk)
- The orbital resonance gaps within the [[Asteroid Belt]]

##### Describe observations of exoplanets that have challenged this simple picture as a universal explanation for planet formation.

- The Existence of [[Planetary Classes#Hot Jupiters]], Jupiter-like planets near their host stars ($< 0.1 \; {\rm AU}$) where [[Core-Accretion Theory]] says they shouldn't be able to exist.

### Question
---
Describe the physics involved in the Earth-Moon interaction whereby the Earth's rotation rate is slowing and the orbital separation is increasing.

### Answer
---
The Earth is transferring angular momentum to the Moon through [[Planetary Migration#Tidal Migration|tidal migration]].

The direction of the [[Planetary Migration#Tidal Migration|tidal migration]] (inward or outward) is determined by the inequality between the Earth's rotational period and the Moon's orbital period. Since the rotational period of the Earth is shorter (faster rotational frequency) than the orbital period of the moon...

- The tidal bulge on Earth is **ahead** of the line of attraction (Earth-Moon line).
- The central body (Earth) loses angular momentum, decreasing the rotational velocity.
- The orbiting body (Moon) gains angular momentum, increasing the orbital velocity.

Since the Moon isn't bound to a fixed orbit, the increased orbital velocity allows the semi-major axis to increases over time.

$$P_{\rm rot} < P_{\rm orbit} \hRightarrow \text{semi-major axis increases}$$

Therefore, the Moon is receding from Earth at $~\sim 3-4\,\pu{cm yr^{-1}}$ and Earth's rotation period is slowing at $\sim 1\,\pu{ms century^{-1}}$. Eventually the Earth-Moon orbit will be synchronous and bodies will be [[Planetary Migration#Tidal Locking|tidally locked]]. (meaning $P_{\rm rot} = P_{\rm orbit}$)

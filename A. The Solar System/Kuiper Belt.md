## Kuiper Belt

The Kuiper Belt is a disk-shaped population of [[Smaller Non-Planetary Bodies#Comet|comet]] nuclei extending from Neptune's orbit $(R \sim 30 \; {\rm AU})$ to several thousand astronomical units from the Sun $(R \in \left[ 30, 1000 \right] \; {\rm AU})$. Though debated, the (highly populated) innermost part of the Kuiper Belt appears to have an outer edge at $R \sim 50 \; {\rm AU}$.

> [!key-idea] **Important Characteristics:**
> - Neptune and Kuiper Belt have a similar relationship as Jupiter and the [[Asteroid Belt]]
> 	- Through [[Orbital Resonance|orbital resonance (mean-motion resonance)]]...
> 	- the *Astroid:Jupiter* system develops the [[Asteroid Belt#Kirkwood Gaps]]
> 	- the *Neptune:Kuiper Belt* develops the [[#Classical Kuiper Belt]]
> 	- Prevents further planetary (or larger body) formation in the region
> - Populated by [[Interstellar Medium#Ice|icy]] remnants ([[Smaller Non-Planetary Bodies#Comet|comet nuclei]]) that did not create larger [[Smaller Non-Planetary Bodies#planetesimals]] or full sized planets during the [[Standard Model of Planetary Formation|formation of the solar system]] due to major perturbations in their orbits caused Neptune.

> - First Kuiper Belt object (a [[Smaller Non-Planetary Bodies#Trans-Neptunian Object (TNO)]]) discovered by MIT professor+grad student (Jewitt+Luu?)

## Classical Kuiper Belt

Very similar to the dust in the rings of Saturn or the [[Asteroid Belt#Kirkwood Gaps]] in the [[Asteroid Belt]], major gravitational perturbations from Neptune can create [[Orbital Resonance|orbital resonances]] in the Kuiper Belt. Given the size of the Kuiper Belt, many different regions have been categorized based on the properties of the Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) found there.

The most notable regions include the *plutinos*, *cubewanos*, and the *twotinos*. The **Classical Kuiper Belt** consist of the *cubewano* region between the 2:3 and 1:2 Neptune resonances at approximately $a \sim 42–48 \; {\rm AU}$. In this region, the objects can remain in their orbits essentially unaltered. This allows $\sim 2/3$ of the KBOs observed to date are found in this region.

## Hot & Cold Population

There are two populations of the KBOs that appear in the Kuiper Belt:

- Cold Population
	- make up the majority of the Kuiper Belt population
	- defined by lower inclinations ($< 5 \degree$) and near-circular orbits, lying between $a \sim 42 - 47 \; {\rm AU}$.
	- redder and brighter
	- smaller KBOs (lower masses)
	- Formed closer to the current position of the Kuiper Belt
		- loose binaries would decompose due to encounters with Neptune?

- Hot Population
	- Significantly smaller portion of the Kuiper Belt population
	- defined by higher inclinations ($> 5 \degree$) and more eccentric orbits
	- larger KBOs (higher masses)
	- Formed near Neptune's original orbit before being scattered out during the [[Planetary Migration|planetary migration]] of the giant planets

> [!note] 
> The terms 'hot' and 'cold' has nothing to do with surface or internal temperatures, but rather refer to the orbits of the objects, by analogy to molecules in a gas, which increase their relative velocity as they heat up.

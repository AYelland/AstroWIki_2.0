The **Boltzmann Equation** describes the relative abundances of atoms in different energy states while in thermal equilibrium.

Assuming a species of particles follow [[Statistical Mechanics#Maxwell-Boltzmann|Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB)]] statistics, we can construct a ratio between the relative abundances of particles being in one energy state compared to another energy state (i.e. the two state system).

$$\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}} = \frac{g_{2}}{g_{1}} \; e^{-(E_{2}. -E_{1})/k_{\rm B} T} \hspace{1cm} \text{where} \hspace{1cm} g_{n} = 2 n^{2}$$

**Fluence** is a form of measurement that describes the number of particles (such as photons or neutrons) incident on a sphere divided by the cross-sectional area of the sphere. In other words, the total number of particles per unit area with which a material is irradiated.

$$
\mathcal{F} \propto \frac{\mathrm{d} N}{\mathrm{d} A} \hspace{1cm} \Rightarrow \hspace{1cm} \left[ \mathcal{F} \right] \equiv \left(\frac{\text{number of particles}}{\text{area}}\right)
$$

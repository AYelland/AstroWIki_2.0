##### Name five molecules found in the interstellar medium and comment on how they are detected. 

| Molecule      | Name                                                    | <nobr>Detection Mechanisms</nobr> | Notes                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| $\ce{H_{2}}$  | <nobr>[[Interstellar Medium#Molecular Hydrogen]]</nobr> | Vibrational Transitions           | Most abundant molecule.                                      |
| $\ce{CO}$     | Carbon Monoxide                                         | Rotational Transitions            | Second most abundant molecule, by a factor of $\sim 10^{4}$. |
| $\ce{CH_{4}}$ | Methane                                                 | Vibrational Transitions           |                                                              |
| $\ce{NH_{3}}$ | Ammonia                                                 | Vibrational Transitions           |                                                              |
| $\ce{H_{2}O}$ | Water                                                   | Vibrational Transitions           |                                                              |

Other include: $\ce{HCN}$, $\ce{H_{2}CO}$ (formaldehyde), $\ce{OH}$, $\dots$ (more than 50 molecules detected up-to date)


**Detection Methods:**

Use the transitions between a molecules different rotational states and molecular states to identify absorption/emission lines in their spectra.
- Rotational Transitions - produce lines in the [[Electromagnetic Spectrum|microwave/radio]]
- Vibrational Transitions - produce lines in the [[Electromagnetic Spectrum|MIR to FIR]]

> [!atom] Notes $\ce{H_{2}}$ and $\ce{CO}$
> 
> $\ce{H_{2}}$ does not have emission/absorption lines in [[Electromagnetic Spectrum|optical or radio]] in the typical ISM temperatures where $\ce{H_{2}}$ is found ($T \sim 10 \; {\rm K}$). The rotational modes transitions for $\ce{H_{2}}$ require $T \sim 100 \; {\rm K}$, meaning the abundance of $\ce{H_{2}}$ is almost impossible to detect directly.

> Therefore, finding the $\ce{H_{2}}$ abundance is done indirectly by measuring the $\ce{CO}$  luminosity - $\ce{H_{2}}$ ratio, which is considered constant in the ISM from empirical observations. ([Soloman, 1897](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987ApJ...319..730S/abstract))
> - $\ce{CO}$ emits far brighter spectral lines than $\ce{H_{2}}$ (due to its polar asymmetry), making it much easier to detect
> - Usually done with millimeter telescopes ([[Instruments#JWST]] is equipped with a MIR IFU, allowing this to be done better.)

##### What limits our ability to directly detect the most common molecules in the ISM?

The existence of spectral transitions.

##### What is meant by "free-free" absorption?

![[Free-Free Absorption]]

##### How is this different from electron scattering?

The difference [[Free-Free Absorption]] and electron scattering ([[Compton Scattering]] at high energies and [[Thomson Scattering]] at low energies) is that a photon is fully absorbed and "lost", whereas in electron scattering, it is "redirected".

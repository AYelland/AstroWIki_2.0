An atom absorbs a photon, allowing the electron to gain enough energy to escape the atom. The electron goes from being bound to being free, ionizing the atom; hence, this is also called *"ionizing absorption"*.

The energy for the change may come from a photon, resulting in the absorption bands known as _ionization edges_ in stellar spectra, or from collisions with other atoms or particles (_collisional ionization_). 

If the energy comes from another excited electron within the atom, the process is known as _autoionization_.

This process is partially responsible for the [[Spectral Features#Balmer Jump]].

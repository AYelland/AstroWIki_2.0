The elastic scattering of light by quasi-spheres that are *of comparable size to the wavelength of the light,* rather than much smaller or much larger.

This scattering takes place in the lower 4,500 m (15,000 ft) of the atmosphere, where many essentially spherical particles with diameters approximately equal to the wavelength of the incident ray may be present.

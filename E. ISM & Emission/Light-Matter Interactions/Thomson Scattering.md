**Thomson Scattering** (also known as **electron scattering** or **coherent scattering**) is the elastic scattering of electromagnetic radiation by a free charged particle (not necessarily an electron). A single, isolated electron cannot absorb a passing photon (see [[No Isolated Emission]]), but it can scatter it into some other direction. 

This classical treatment of the electron-photon scattering makes the following assumptions:
- Elastic scattering (i.e. no energy loss in photon)
- The photon energy is much smaller than the mass-energy of the particle (Equivalently, the wavelength of the light is much greater than the Compton wavelength of the particle, so quantum effects can be ignored).
- The electron is non-relativistic.

In the low energy limit, it is the same as [[Compton Scattering]].

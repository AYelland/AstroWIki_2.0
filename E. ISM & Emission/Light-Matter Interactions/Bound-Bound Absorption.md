An atom absorbs a photon, allowing the electron to enter an excited state within an atom. The electron remains attached (bound) to the atom both before and after the change. 

When the energy is increased, a photon is absorbed; when the energy is reduced, a photon is emitted. Boundâ€“bound transitions produce the emission and absorption lines in spectra.

The atom is not ionized as in [[Bound-Free Absorption]].

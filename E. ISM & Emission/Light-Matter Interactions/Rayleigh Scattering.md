The elastic scattering of light by spheres that are *much smaller than the wavelength of light.*

In comparison to [[Thomson Scattering]], Rayleigh scattering is from polarizable entities. The incident light induces a dipole moment, which re-radiates. Thomson scattering is scattering from free unbound charged "unpolarizable" particles.

The [[Intensity|intensity]] of scattered light is...

$$I_{\lambda}(\theta) = I_{0} \left( \frac{1+\cos^{2} \theta}{2 R^{2}} \right) \left( \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} \right)^{4} \left( \frac{n^{2}-1}{n^{2}+2} \right)^{2} \left( \frac{d}{2} \right)^{6} \propto \frac{1}{\lambda^{4}}$$

where
- $I_{0}$ is the light intensity before the interaction with the particle
- $R$ is the distance between the particle and the observer
- $\theta$ is the scattering angle
- $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light under consideration
- $n$ is the refractive index of the particle
- $d$ is the diameter of the particle

The change of sky color at sunset (red nearest the sun, blue furthest away) is caused by Rayleigh scattering by atmospheric gas particles, which are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light.

Since $\lambda_{blue} < \lambda_{red}$ , the scattering for blue is much stronger such that the red light makes it though the atmosphere and the blue light is scattered off in other directions. Therefore, we see blue being scattered/reflected above us preferentially.

The grey/white color of the clouds is caused by [[Mie Scattering]] by water droplets, which are of a comparable size to the wavelengths of visible light.

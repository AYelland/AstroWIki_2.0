### Question
---
Summarize the state of the experimental field of 21cm cosmology and what it hopes to accomplish.

### Answer
---
See [[Spectral Features#21cm line]] for explanation of the spectral line physics. 

**What is the use of this line in studying cosmology?** 
- Can use this transition to map the fraction of [[Interstellar Medium#Atomic Hydrogen|neutral hydrogen]] over cosmic time, which tells us about the epoch of [[Cosmological Timeline#Reionization|reionization]].

- As [[Cosmic Microwave Background|CMB]] photons pass through a neutral hydrogen region, those photons near $21\,\pu{cm}$ wavelengths can be absorbed by neutral hydrogen. See [these slides](https://www2.yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~ppp.ws/PPP2015/slides/takahashi.pdf).

**What experiments can do this?**
- [[Instruments#CHIME|CHIME]]. 
	- Also can measure [[Baryon Acoustic Oscillations|BAO]] signal with these measurements. 
	- Has only observed the 21cm cosmological signal when temperature maps are correlated with [[Active Galactic Nuclei#Quasar / Quasi-Stellar Object (QSO)|quasar]] maps.
	- CHIME images stacked to increase signal to noise.
- [[Instruments#HERA|HERA]]. 
	- Can allow us to study first stars and epoch of reionization. 
	- Will place limits on 21cm power spectrum and thus our understanding of how ionized bubbled form and evolve. 
	- More robust against astrophysical foreground, but still need accurate foreground models in all cases to see any signal at all
- [[Instruments#MWA|MWA]] and [[Instruments#SKA|SKA]] similar.

For all these, the astrophysical foreground (e.g. [[Synchrotron Radiation|synchrotron radiation]] from galactic sources like jets in [[Binary Stars#X-Ray Binary|XRBs]] and [[Active Galactic Nuclei|AGN]], [[Stellar Explosions#Supernova|SNe]] remnants, [[Nebulae#Pulsar Wind Nebula|pulsar wind nebulae]], galactic [[Interstellar Medium|ISM]] and [[Gamma Ray Burst|GRBs]]) is orders of magnitude bigger than the cosmological signal. This makes for very, very hard post-processing. (Haochen Wang here at MKI does this.)

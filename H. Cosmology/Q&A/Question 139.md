### Question
---
When (or at what redshift) did the universe become (i) matter dominated? (ii) optically thin to electron scattering? What temperature was the CMB at these times? What significance did these events have for the CMB?

### Answer
---
##### (i) Matter Dominated

[[Cosmological Timeline#Matter-Radiation Equality]] ($z \sim 3000$)

##### (ii) Optically Thin to Electron Scattering

[[Cosmological Timeline#Recombination]] ($z \sim 1100$)

##### What temperature was the CMB at these times?

$$T = T_{0} (1+z) \hWhere T_{0} = 2.7 \; \pu{K}$$

- [[Cosmological Timeline#^MR-T|Matter-Radiation Equality Temperature]]: $T \sim 8500 \; {\rm K}$
- [[Cosmological Timeline#^rec-T|Recombination Temperature]]: $T \sim 3000 \; {\rm K}$

##### What significance did these events have for the CMB?

For [[Cosmological Timeline#Matter-Radiation Equality]]:
- Before this, no structure forms because the expansion is too fast. 
- After this, [[Dark Matter|dark matter]] starts to collapse and set potential wells in which the baryons oscillate with gravity against photon pressure (once enough time as passed for sound waves to travel in them, i.e. they "entered the sound horizon" as in [[Question 131]]).
- Once potential wells are set, the [[Cosmic Microwave Background#CMB Power Spectrum]] is impacted as photons climb out of those wells and get redshifted (the non-integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect). This affects the power spectrum on large scales (small $l$ plateau), since the DM potential wells are not varying at that scale.
- $\Omega_M$ sets the heights of the peaks on the power spectrum (see [[Question 129]]) and the redshift of M-R equality. Therefore, $z_{mr}$ is also related to heights of peaks.

For [[Cosmological Timeline#Recombination]]:
- Sets the scales that show up as peaks on the [[Cosmic Microwave Background#CMB Power Spectrum]]
- [[Baryon Acoustic Oscillations|BAO]] which is just the same thing as the first peak.

##### Are the anisotropies related to galaxy formation?

[[Cosmic Microwave Background#Anisotropies|CMB anisotropies]] $\implies$ matter overdensities and underdensities in the early universe. These perturbations are believed to ultimately grow into the large scale structure of the universe like [[Galaxy Cluster|galaxy clusters]] and [[Galaxy Group|galaxy groups]]; however, silk damping (photon diffusion damping on small scales) wipes out structures smaller than the silk mass $\sim 10^{13} \; {\rm M_{\odot}}$

##### What is the current observational status?

- Planck gives amazing anisotropy data and [[Cosmic Microwave Background#CMB Power Spectrum]] data down to very small ($l \simeq 2000$) scales, and we are reaching the statistical limit of what can be done with [[Cosmic Microwave Background|CMB]].
- There is need for higher resolution measurements of [[Cosmic Microwave Background#CMB Polarization]].
- Future observations from [[Instruments#BICEP|BICEP3]], Simons Observatory, and [[Instruments#CMB-S4|CMB-S4]].

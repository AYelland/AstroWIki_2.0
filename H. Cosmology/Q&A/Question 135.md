### Question
---
How can the age of the universe be estimated empirically? Do the current estimates agree with that obtained from the Hubble constant?

### Answer

There are a couple of empirical methods we can use to determine the age of the universe. All of which are roughly consistent with the [[Timescales#Hubble Time]] ($t_{H} \sim 14 \; {\rm Gyr}$).

**1) Ages of Globular Clusters**

- [[Stellar Clusters#Globular Cluster|Globular clusters]] are thought to be very old, such that they provide a good lower bound on age of universe.
- We can estimate their age from the [[Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram#Terminal-Age Main Sequence (TAMS)|turn-off point of the main-squence]] (see [[Question 17]]).
- We find GCs with ages of $\sim 12-13\,\pu{Gyr}$. 

The figure below is just for open clusters but the same principle applies to globular.

**2) White Dwarf Cooling**

- [[Stellar Classes#White Dwarf|White dwarfs]] cool from $T\sim 10^4\,\pu{K}$ to their observable temperatures as they deplete their thermal energy supply.
	- Energy is carried via electron conduction (highly efficient process $\implies$ isothermal)
	- Thin non-degenerate layer on surface transfers heat/energy less efficiently & loses energy.
- The [[Luminosity|luminosity]] scales with the core temperature as $L \propto T_c^{7/2}$. (cooling time $\sim 200 \; {\rm Myr}$)
- As a result, we can use the coolest white dwarfs to get a lower limit on age of the universe, if we understand the processes by which they cool. 
- Yields an estimate of $\sim 12-13\,\pu{Gyr}$.

**3) Age of MW Stellar Halo Stars**

- The [[Galaxies - General#The Milky Way|MW]] [[Anatomy of a Galaxy#Stellar Halo]] is thought to contain old [[Stellar Populations|stellar populations]] (Pop. II), and as such, their age can be useful to constraining the age of the universe. 
- However, these stars originate from multiple populations (mergers) that can make this measurement difficult.

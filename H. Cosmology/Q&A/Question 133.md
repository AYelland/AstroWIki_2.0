### Question

Summarize the observational evidence in favor of the standard "Big Bang" model of the universe.

### Answer
---
**Observational Evidence:**

1. The universe is expanding
	- We see everything moving away from us in a way that implies space is expanding ([[Hubble#Hubble Law]]).
	- This means that we are at the center of some explosion of galaxies (no observational evidence for, Copernican principle), or that the universe is expanding uniformly (the same everywhere in space). 
	- The universe must have been much smaller, denser and hotter.

2. [[Cosmic Microwave Background]]
	- Originates in early universe and [[Redshift#Cosmological Expansion|redshifted]] by the cosmological expansion of universe.
	- The universe used to emit as a [[Blackbody Radiation|blackbody]] until it cooled and expanded so photons could free stream.
	- Implies hot and dense early universe.

3. [[Big Bang Nucleosynthesis]] + Abundance
	- In early universe ($\sim 2\,\pu{min}$ after big bang) nuclear fusion could occur, fusing hydrogen into helium and some others like lithium (see [[Question 146]]).
	- The expected abundances from modelling the big bang match the observed abundances (although maybe they don't? Is cosmic lithium problem resolved?)

4. Galaxy Evolution
	- High redshift galaxies have different [[Stellar Populations|stellar populations]] than local galaxies $\implies$ evolution over cosmic time(?)
	- The distribution of [[Galaxy Cluster|galaxy clusters]] match expectations for structure formation after big bang

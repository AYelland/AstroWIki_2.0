### Question
---
Describe, qualitatively, the synthesis of light elements in the Big Bang. What is the deuterium bottleneck, and how does it help produce the right helium abundance? What role does radiation play in Big Bang nucleosynthesis?

##### Describe, qualitatively, the synthesis of light elements in the Big Bang.

![[Big Bang Nucleosynthesis#General Information]]

##### What is the deuterium bottleneck, and how does it help produce the right helium abundance? 

![[Big Bang Nucleosynthesis#Deuterium Bottleneck]]

##### What role does radiation play in Big Bang nucleosynthesis?

The universe is radiation dominated during the time of [[Big Bang Nucleosynthesis|BBN]]. As we can see from above, the background temperature directly affects when [[Deuteron Fusion|deuteron fusion]] can begin, and when the bottleneck can be overcame.

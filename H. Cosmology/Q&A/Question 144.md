##### What is the baryonic contribution to the cosmological mass density and how is it determined? 

We have measured $\Omega_b \simeq 0.05$ and $\Omega_M \simeq 0.3$, such that baryons make up about 18% of the mass budget. We measure this via...
1. The baryon loading effect of the [[Cosmic Microwave Background#CMB Power Spectrum]] (see [[Question 129]]). This gives constraints on $\Omega_{M}$ for the overall amplitude and on $\Omega_{b}$ by comparing the difference between the first and second peaks.
2. [[Big Bang Nucleosynthesis]] models and the primordial element abundances finds consistency of the baryon fraction with [[Cosmic Microwave Background|CMB]]. ![[BBN.png|align:center|400]]

##### Where are the bulk of the baryons in our Universe?

If we add up all the baryons we see in stars, galaxies, the [[Interstellar Medium|ISM]], the [[Intracuster Medium|ICM]], etc, we only get $\sim 50\%$ of the baryons we'd expect from measurements of the [[Cosmic Microwave Background|CMB]]. and [[Big Bang Nucleosynthesis|BBN]].

This is known as the "**missing baryon problem**".

Solution: Approximately half of the baryons are located in phase of the [[Intergalactic Medium|IGM]] along cosmic filaments called the *warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM)* ($10^{5}-10^{7}\,\pu{K}$). We have recently observed this medium along the line of sight to distant [[Active Galactic Nuclei#Quasar / Quasi-Stellar Object (QSO)|quasars]] using the [[Cosmic Microwave Background#Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect|SZ-effect]]; however, it is very difficult because the gas is very diffuse.

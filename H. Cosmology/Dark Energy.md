**Dark Energy** (represented by the **Cosmological Constant**) is an unknown form of energy that affects the universe on the largest scales. It acts like a negative pressure (a positive pressure pushes in isotropically on a small body, such that a negative pressure pulls on it isotropically) driving the acceleration of the universes expansion. 
- Maybe not a constant, rather a scalar field which changes in time ("quintessence")
- Maybe some exotic modified gravity

Particle physics predicts $\Lambda \sim 1/t_{\rm planck} \implies \Omega_{\Lambda} \sim 10^{120}$, which is 120 orders of magnitude different than modelling of [[Cosmic Microwave Background|CMB]].

**What is the evidence of "dark energy"?**

1. [[Cosmic Microwave Background#CMB Power Spectrum]] Fitting
	- The power spectrum constrains the cosmological density parameters.
	- $\Omega_{M} \simeq 0.3 \; , \; \Omega_{k} \simeq \Omega_{r} \simeq 0 \implies \Omega_{\Lambda} \simeq 0.7 \neq 0$.

2. Integrated Sachs-Wolfe Effect (see [[Question 128]])
	- We see large scale redshifting consistent with an accelerated expansion that only occurs if universe is $\Lambda$-dominated or radiation-dominated

3. [[Stellar Explosions#Supernova]] Cosmology
	- We can measure [[Distances#Luminosity Distance|luminosity distance]] of [[Stellar Explosions#Type Ia|Type 1a SNe]] ("standard candles") and plot them against [[Redshift|redshift]] ($z\sim 1-2$).
	- At higher redshifts, we can see where differences in cosmological models become more pronounced.
		- For larger $\Omega_{\Lambda}$, the luminosity distance to an object is larger because there was a slower expansion in the past.

Using these three sources (and more), we make correlation plot between $\Omega_{M}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda}$.

## Evidence of Dark Matter

5 Main Sources of [[Dark Matter]] Evidence:
1. [[Velocity Dispersion#Rotation Curve|Galaxy Rotation Curves]]
2. [[Velocity Dispersion#Escape Velocity|Galactic Escape Velocity]]
3. [[Velocity Dispersion#Cluster Velocity Dispersion]]
4. [[Galaxy Cluster#Bullet Cluster|The Bullet Cluster]]
5. [[Cosmic Microwave Background#CMB Power Spectrum|3rd Peak of CMB Power Spectrum]]

## Methods of Studying Dark Matter
*(Source: Ben Lehmann Pappalardo fellowship talk)*

### Quantum Sensors
*"Does dark matter interact non-gravitationally?"*

Lab experiments can probe "heavy DM" like billiard balls, but for very light DM our detector needs to detect the whole wavefunction of the DM. Thus, we would need *quantum detectors*.

Dark matter also interacts with *quasiparticles* which are collective excitations of systems (think normal modes of a spring-mass system) like a plasmon (or a phonon). One finds that detectors can be more sensitive to collective modes, and importantly since they are not elementary, they are also **controllable** with adjustable sensitivity. Allows one to put constraint curves in the interaction cross-section / mass plane.

### Cosmology
*"Structure reveals structure"*

Are there symmetries in the dark sector that influence how DM behaves in the very high-temperature early universe? If so, what are their signatures now? 

Yes: Imprints on [[Cosmic Microwave Background#Power Spectrum|CMB power spectrum]] as a result of resonances, long scale interactions and phase transitions of DM.

### Gravitational Waves
*"If there isn't another type of force or particle, what can gravity alone do for us?"*

Gravity is universal, super-weak, so we'll never see a single DM particle with gravity alone (unless DM is [[#PBH]]).

If there is a class of BBH mergers near galactic centers, where DM is strongly clustered, then potentially there would be a signal that can tell us more about DM as it interacts.
- [[Instruments#Pulsar Timing Arrays]] of SMBH mergers might be the ones where such a signal is found
- Intermediate-mass mergers wont work.
- [[Instruments#NANOGrav]] will do it. Focus is on stochastic background of GWs, not individual mergers. 

## Properties of Dark Matter

**What we do know about DM:**
- Particles are slow/cold (non-dissipative)
- It doesn't interact with EM in a way we've observed
- It acts like regular old matter (i.e. [[Galaxy Cluster#Bullet Cluster]])
- Strongly clustered
- Stable
- Essential (necessary to explain what we've seen)

We have also constrained its interaction cross-section and mass, though the possible parameter space is massive.
- interaction strength is at least as strong as gravity alone
- mass is less than about a solar mass
- wavelength can't be more than about a galaxy size

**What we don't know about DM:**
- What kind of particle? elementary?
- Any non-gravitational interactions?
- Role in cosmic history?
- How does it fit into fundamental physics?

## Potential Sources
### MACHOs

**Massive Compact Halo Object (MACHOs)** are astrophysical bodies that emits little or no radiation and drifts through interstellar space unassociated with any planetary system.

These dim stars or other dense objects have been ruled out by [[Gravitational Lensing#Microlensing|microlensing]], the temporary brightening of a distant object due to a closer massive object bending the light rays closer together. For [[Gravitational Lensing#Microlensing|microlensing]] to explain DM, it would have to occur on a much higher frequency than what we observe.

### WIMPs

**Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs)** could possibly be source for DM; however, there are no detections of WIMPs so far. 

A WIMP candidate interacts with matter via gravity or through another force (not included in the Standard Model) as weak as or weaker than the weak nuclear force, to a non-vanishing strength.

### CDM

**Cold Dark Matter (CDM)** is a type of dark matter that moves slowly compared to the speed of light ($v \ll c$). As such, it is collisionless and interacts solely through gravity.

**Axions** are a specific candidate of CDM that solves strong-CP problem of QCD. People also consider other "axion-like particles".

**Properties**
- pressureless ideal fluid
- non-baryonic
	- It consists of matter other than protons and neutrons (and electrons, by convention, although electrons are not baryons).
- cold
	- Its velocity is far less than the speed of light at the epoch of radiation–matter equality (thus neutrinos are excluded, being non-baryonic but not cold).
- dissipationless
	- It cannot cool by radiating photons.
- collisionless
	- The dark matter particles interact with each other and other particles only through gravity and possibly the weak force.

### LCDM

**Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM $\equiv$ LCDM)** is *the standard model of Big Bang cosmology*. 

LCDM is a specific type of [[#CDM]] model that also accounts for the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) associated with dark energy, which drives the acceleration of expansion.

It provides a reasonably good account of:
- the existence and structure of the [[Cosmic Microwave Background|CMB]]
- the large-scale structure in the distribution of galaxies
- the observed abundances of hydrogen (including deuterium), helium, and lithium (see [[Big Bang Nucleosynthesis|BBN]])
- the accelerating expansion of the universe observed in the light from distant galaxies and [[Stellar Explosions#Supernova|supernovae]]

Despite successes, there does exist a number of tensions between LCDM and observations, and the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model) has a good job of reviewing these.

### SIDM

**Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM)** is a type of dark matter interacts through gravity, as well as through self-interactions that allow particles to scatter and transfer energy and momentum.

### WDM

**Warm Dark Matter (WDM)** is a type of dark matter that is collisionless but moves with a faster velocity than [[#CDM]]. This makes it harder to form less massive halos.

### MOND

**Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)** is the idea that dark matter is not a type of matter, but instead, it can be accounted for through modifications to our theory of gravity.

### BEC

**Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC)** is a type of dark matter particles with such a low mass that their de Broglie wavelength is on the length scale of galaxies and leads to interference patterns in halos.

### FDM

**Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM)** is so light that it is wavelike(?). The idea is that it smooths out small scales and creates interference patterns in structure.

De-Broglie wavelength (for neutrinos its $\sim 0.5\,\rm{mm}$):$$\lambda_{DB} = \frac{h}{p} \sim \frac{1}{\rm{mass}}$$
- FDM effectively smooths out smallest scale structure
- Scalar field with periodic potential (Taylor expands to a quadratic)
- Primordially produced by misalignment mechanism, which leads to behaving like [[#CDM]] on large scales, but not on small scales
- One potential solution to [[Question 125|core-cusp problem]], along with [[#SIDM]] and baryonic feedback.
- Forms soliton core, a high-density region with constant central density and a sharp cutoff at $\sim \,1\pu{kpc}$ 

## PBH

**Primordial Black Holes (PBH)** are dark matter candidates that are [[Black Hole#Micro Black Hole|micro black holes]] formed by non- baryonic/stellar evolution means. Almost the entire parameter space for PBHs is ruled out.

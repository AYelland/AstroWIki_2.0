##### What is the "Shapiro time delay"?

The **Shapiro Time Delay** is a gravitational time delay that arises from time dilation near massive bodies in general relativity.

$$\Delta t_{\rm grav} = - \int \Phi \; \rd s = - \underbrace{\left[ \frac{1 + z_{\rm lens}}{c} \fpar{D_{L} D_{S}}{D_{LS}} \right]}_{D_{\Delta t} \, \propto \, H_{0}^{-1}} \, \psi_{\rm 2D}$$

If we bounce light off of a mirror (or anything that reflects) and the signal has to pass near a high-mass object, we should see that the signal takes a bit longer than expected due to time dilation. Roughly speaking, the time dilation increases with spacetime curvature, so the coordinate time along the null geodesic will be larger than if there were no curvature (but since its a null geodesic the proper time interval will be zero).

This is one of the four [[General Relativity#Classical Tests of General Relativity]]. 

##### Where was it first measured?

It was predicted in 1964 by Shapiro, and first measured here at MIT in 1966. 

By shooting a radar signal at Mercury and Venus when they were almost at the opposite side of the [[sun]], they measured the time delay for the signal to be reflected back, and compared the result to the theoretical expectations. It matched the GR prediction by about $\sim 0.2 \; {\rm ms}$.

### Question
---
Why are more X-ray binaries and radio pulsars found (per unit mass) in globular clusters than in other parts of the galaxy?

> - Dense $\implies$ more dynamical encounters $\implies$ more binaries (per unit mass) $\implies$ more [[Binary Stars#X-Ray Binary|XRBs]] (combined with "Old" logic)

**[[Binary Stars#X-Ray Binary]] Formation Requirements:**
- Long periods of time such that a massive star can evolve into a NS or BH
- Dense stellar regions with many dynamical encounters
	- The NS or BH needs to be able to gravitationally capture a younger star (relative to the compact object) for mass accretion

> [!note]- Dynamical Formation Channels
> Normal binaries often kick out their companions when one of the stars goes [[Stellar Explosions#Supernova|supernova]] *(see [[Question 59]])*. This means we need dense environments that allow close, tidal captures or binary swapping.

**[[Neutron Star#Pulsar|Radio Pulsar]] Formation Requirements:**
- Long periods of time such that a massive star can evolve into a NS or BH

**[[Stellar Clusters#Globular Cluster]]:**
Globular clusters are very old and dense stellar regions. Because of this, they tend to have a higher population of [[Neutron Star|neutron stars]] and more dynamical encounters (per unit mass). 

These conditions will lead naturally lead to higher chances of binary capture for **XRBs** and a higher population high-spin neutron stars for **radio pulsars**.

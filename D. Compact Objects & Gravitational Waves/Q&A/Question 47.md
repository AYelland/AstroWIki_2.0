##### What is the Eddington limit?

![[Luminosity#Eddington Limit]]

##### How is it manifested in (i) ordinary stars? (ii) accreting X-ray sources?

**(i) Ordinary Stars**

When a star exceeds [[Luminosity#Eddington Limit]], the radiation pressure drives significant stellar winds in the outer layers, leading to significant mass loss.
- Only happens in most massive stars, since $L_{\rm Edd} \gg L_{\odot}$
	- since $L\sim M^{3.5}$ (for [[Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram#Main Sequence (MS)|MS]] stars) and $L_{Edd} \sim M$ eventually as mass increases the luminosity overtakes the Eddington limit and the star begins to blow out mass.
- An increased opacity in the star increases the outward radiation pressure (via more interactions, perhaps due to [[Interstellar Medium#Dust|dust]]), and thus, lowers the Eddington luminosity
- Massive stars are Eddington-limited in [[Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram#Post-Main Sequence|post-MS]] evolution, and thus travel *horizontally* on the [[Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram|HR-Diagram]].
- Derivation assumes spherical symmetry. When the symmetry is broken, this limit can be surpassed, allowing a super-Eddington luminosity ($L > L_{\rm Edd}$), without breaking hydrostatic equilibrium.

**(ii) Accreting X-ray Sources**

The x-ray  source originates from the accretion of matter onto a compact object (such as a [[Black Hole|black hole]]).
- Accretion liberates gravitational potential energy as gas loses angular momentum and falls onto the compact object.
	- $L = \eta \dot{M} c^{2}$ (energy radiated per time = efficiency $\times$ mass-energy gained per time). 
	- The accretion efficiency $\eta$ is spin-dependent.
		- $\sim 6 \%$ for [[Black Hole#Schwarzschild Black Hole]]
		- $\sim 40 \%$ for a maximally spinning [[Black Hole#Kerr Black Hole]]
		- Estimating as $10 \% = 0.1$ is fine.
- Accreting sources can also be Eddington-limited like stars, in that:
	- For $L/L_{Edd} \lesssim 0.5$, they have a standard thin, radiatively efficient accretion flow
	- For $L/L_{Edd} \gtrsim 0.5$, they have a puffed-up disk, radiatively inefficient accretion flow
		- Radiation pressure increases the height-to-radius ratio of the disk.
- Same as with stars, the lack of spherical symmetry allows for super-Eddington luminosity ($L > L_{\rm Edd}$). This is more common with accretion disks because of this too.

### Question

It is believed that most stars leave a collapsed remnant at the end of their evolution. What stars leave (i) white dwarfs? (ii) neutron stars? (iii) black holes?

### Answer

The exact numbers of masses below are not known; however, there seems to be consistent sources within $\pm 25 \%$.

| Initial Mass ($M_{\odot}$) | End State                                                                | Final Mass ($M_{\odot}$) |
| :------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------: |
|      $\lesssim 0.05$       | [[Planetary Classes\|Planet]]                                            |          (same)          |
|       $0.05 - 0.08$        | [[Stellar Classes#Brown Dwarf]]                                          |          (same)          |
|        $0.08 - 0.5$        | [[Stellar Classes#Red Dwarf]]                                            |          (same)          |
|        $0.5 - 0.8$         | [[Stellar Classes#Main Sequence]]                                        |          (same)          |
|         $0.8 - 8$          | [[Stellar Classes#White Dwarf]] (maybe [[Stellar Classes#Black Dwarf]]?) |        $0.4 - 1$         |
|          $8 - 20$          | [[Neutron Star]]                                                         |         $1 - 3$          |
|        $\gtrsim 20$        | [[Black Hole]]                                                           |       $\gtrsim 3$        |

##### Why do they leave a remanent?

**(i) [[Stellar Classes#White Dwarf]]**

- In the [[Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram#Post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (Post-AGB)]], the stellar winds drive major mass loss, creating a planetary nebula around an inert core.
	- The composition of the core it dependent on the initial stellar mass and what the star was able to fuse during its lifetime
- The remanent inert core of the star becomes a [[Stellar Classes#White Dwarf]].

**(ii) Neutron Stars & (iii) Black Holes**

- In massive stars, strong winds drive major mass loss throughout its evolutionary process *(See [[Question 22]])*
- The [[Chandrasekhar Limit]] ($\sim 1.4 \; M_{\odot}$) dictates how large a stellar core can be when it is electron degenerate. If the core exceeds this limit, it becomes unstable and will collapse on itself.
	- For stars with $8 \; M_{\odot} \lesssim M \lesssim 20 \; M_{\odot}$
		- The collapse will trigger neutron degeneracy, providing a final stabilizing pressure for the core.
		- This will create a neutron star and a [[Stellar Explosions#Type II]] supernovae.
	- For stars with $M \gtrsim 20 \; M_{\odot}$
		- The collapse will overcome the neutron degeneracy and compress into a singularity.
		- This will create a black hole and a [[Stellar Explosions#Type II]] supernovae.
	- During collapse, the high temperature and pressure briefly allow the fusion of heavier elements
	- Maximum core mass for a neutron star (before it collapses into a black hole) is an area of active research, but estimated to be $\sim 2 -3 \; M_{\odot}$.

What properties of supermassive black holes correlate with properties of the host galaxy?

### Answer

###### Stellar Velocity Dispersion

The mass of the [[Black Hole#Supermassive Black Hole|SMBH]] ($M_{\rm BH}$) scales with the stellar velocity ($\sigma$) of the galaxy and galactic bulge. *(See [[Velocity Dispersion#M-Sigma Relation]])*
- Recall that $\sigma$ correlates with the bulge mass and luminosity, such that $M_{\rm BH}$ also correlates with galactic properties.

Also see [[Question 124]].

###### Star Formation Rate (SFR)

The stellar formation rate of the galaxy also correlates with the activities of the supermassive black holes. Most galaxies tend to fall into two types: a *"red sequence"* and a *"blue cloud"*. 

- Red sequence galaxies tend to be non-star-forming elliptical galaxies with little gas and dust
- Blue cloud galaxies tend to be dusty star-forming spiral galaxies 

The process of which star formation is turned off is called “quenching,” and one way to explain it is through [[Active Galactic Nuclei|AGN]] feedback. Simulations have shown that gas accreting onto supermassive black holes in galactic centers produces high-energy jets; the released energy can expel enough cold gas to quench star formation.

What is the historical significance of the Hulse-Taylor binary radio pulsar to physics?

### Answer
---
The Hulse-Taylor was the first binary [[Neutron Star#Pulsar|pulsar]]-[[Neutron Star|NS]] system discovered (Hulse + Taylor, 1974)
- Won Nobel Prize in 1993 for being the first discovered binary with a [[Neutron Star#Pulsar|pulsar]]
- Due to the [[Binary Stars|binary]] orbit, the radio pulses of the pulsar exhibited a periodic effect (timescale $\sim 8$ hours) of arriving "a little early" and then "a little late"
- This implied the existence of the non-visible companion in the binary. With large [[Binary Stars#For a Spectroscopic Binary|radial velocity amplitudes]], they were able to get a mass estimate $\implies$ [[Neutron Star|neutron star]]

This system is also very important as a test of general relativity and gravitational waves. 
- Two compact objects in a close binary should be losing orbital energy and angular momentum to [[Gravitational Waves]].
	- [[Gravitational Waves#Gravitational Radiation]] carries away energy from the system, such that to conserve energy, the overall energy of the binary must also decrease.
	- For a [[Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion|Keplerian Orbit]], the energy of the binary is roughly $$E_{\rm binary} \simeq -\frac{G M_{1} M_{2}}{2 a}$$ such that if the energy decreases, so must $a$.

By comparing the change in period ($\dot{P}$) and comparing general relativity predictions, we found incredible agreement between the theory and data for over 30 years:

This was one of the first pieces of evidence for the existence of [[Gravitational Waves#Gravitational Radiation|gravitational radiation]].

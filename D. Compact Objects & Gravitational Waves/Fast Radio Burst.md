---
A transient radio pulse of length ranging from a fraction of a millisecond to 3 seconds, caused by some high-energy astrophysical process not yet understood. Most FRBs are extragalactic, but the first Milky Way FRB was detected by [[Instruments#CHIME]] in April 2020.

Theorized to come from compact-object mergers and [[Neutron Star#Magnetar|magnetars]] arising from normal [[Core-Collapse|core-collapse]] [[Stellar Explosions#Supernova|supernovae]].

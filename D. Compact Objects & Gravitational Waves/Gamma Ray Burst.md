A **gamma ray burst** is an intense, jet-shaped burst of high-energy gamma rays ($E \gtrsim 100 \; {\rm keV}$) from some distant, extragalactic source. They are classified on the duration of the burst into [[#Long Duration GRBs (LGRBs)]] and [[#Short Duration GRBs (SGRBs)]]; however, the line between the two classifications is fuzzy. After an initial flash of gamma rays, a longer-lived "afterglow" is usually emitted across all wavelengths.

**Properties:**
- Most energetic events since the big bang ($\sim 10^{47}\,\pu{J}$)
- Extragalactic Sources
	- We have never observed a GRB in the Milky Way. 
	- First detected by satellites in the 1960s while monitoring for forbidden nuclear testing. 
- Non-thermal and non-repeating
	- Distinguishes them from Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs), which may just be [[Neutron Star#Magnetar|magnetars]]. *(see [[Question 66]])*
- After an initial flash of gamma rays, a longer-lived "afterglow" is usually emitted at longer wavelengths *(see [[Question 67]])*

### Short Duration GRBs (SGRBs)

> [!measure] Duration: ~ millisconds to seconds ($< 2 \; {\rm s}$)

**Origin:** Thought to primarily originate from [[Stellar Explosions#Kilonova|kilonovae]] ([[Neutron Star|NS]]-[[Neutron Star|NS]] binary mergers). However, there have recently been a couple of detections associated with supernova events.

**Additional Notes:**
- Found both in [[Galaxy Classification#Elliptical Galaxy|elliptical]] and [[Galaxy Classification#Spiral Galaxy|spiral]] galaxies
- Not typically associated with massive stellar progenitors (i.e. supernovae events)
- First afterglow was found with [[Instruments#SWIFT]] (2005)

**Comparison to [[#Long Duration GRBs (LGRBs)]]:**
- SGRBs afterglows tend to have lower energy and density scales
- Harder spectra than LGRBs (in both the spectral slope and cutoff energy)
- Comparable variability timescales with the first $2 \; {\rm s}$ of LGRBs

> [!note] 
> In 2017, [[Instruments#LIGO]] and [[Instruments#VIRGO]] observed the [[Gravitational Waves|gravitational waves]] of a [[Stellar Explosions#Kilonova|NS-NS merger]] (GW170817). [[Instruments#Fermi]] and [[Instruments#INTEGRAL]] then detected a [[#Short Duration GRBs (SGRBs)|SGRB]] 1.7 seconds following the merger.

> Q: *"Why after?"*

> A: *GWs are thought to propagate through the universe unimpeded (excluding large gravitational potential wells that might lense the GW, but this is unobserved so far), at the speed of light. Therefore, if the GWs and gamma rays were emitted at the same time and place, we should observe them at the same time, given that most of the universe is optically thin to gamma rays. So, if we donâ€™t observe them at the same time (i.e. the gamma rays are delayed), then we know their emission mechanism happened after the GWs are produced. On the other hand, if we assume both GWs and gamma rays are emitted at the same time, then we can place a constraint on the speed of gravity ($c$ in [[General Relativity|GR]]).*


### Long Duration GRBs (LGRBs)

> [!measure] Duration: ~ seconds to minutes ($> 2 \; {\rm s}$)

**Origin:** Thought to primarily originate from the [[Core-Collapse|core-collapse]] of a massive star ([[Stellar Explosions#Type Ic-BL]] supernovae) as it forms a [[Neutron Star|neutron star]] or a [[Black Hole|black hole]]. However, there have recently been a couple of detections associated with binary compact object mergers.

**Additional Notes:**
- Found in star forming regions of [[Galaxy Classification#Spiral Galaxy|spiral galaxies]]
- First localization in 1997 from afterglow measurements
	- Provided observational evidence for relativistic expansion from collimated jets opening angles ($\theta \sim 3 - 10 \degree$)
	- Afterglows last $\sim$ days - weeks

**Comparison to [[#Short Duration GRBs (SGRBs)]]:**
- LGRBs afterglows tend to have lower energy and density scales
- Softer spectra than SGRBs (in both the spectral slope and cutoff energy)
- Exhibit spectral lags (i.e. hard spectra evolves to soft spectra)

Intense radiation thought to be released during a [[Stellar Explosions#Supernova|supernovae]] as a high-mass star implodes to form a [[Neutron Star|neutron star]] or a [[Black Hole|black hole]]. 

Has been a recent observation of a $\sim 50 \; {\rm s}$ long GRB from a binary compact object merger.

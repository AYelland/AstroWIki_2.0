## Cooling Flow
*(See [[Question 125]])*

The **cooling flow** is the flow of the intracluster medium (ICM) flowing into the cooled region of a cluster. The hot ICM in the cores of [[Galaxy Cluster|galaxy clusters]] should be cooling at a rate of ~10s to 1000s of ${\rm M_{\odot}/yr}$ by emission of X-rays (and forming into stars).

$$L \propto \rho^{2} \, T^{-1/2}$$

Since $L$ ~ $\int dV\,$(rate of interactions/volume) and rate/vol ~ $\rho^2 \sigma v$ (weird assumptions going into why the integral doesnt matter, maybe we're assuming V remains constant when increasing $\rho\,$?). And the scattering cross section for [[Bremsstrahlung Radiation|bremsstrahlung]] goes as $T^{-1/2}$

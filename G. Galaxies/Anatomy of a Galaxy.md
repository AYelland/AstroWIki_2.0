## Galactic Center

The rotational center and the barycenter of a galaxy. This is where it's presumed that many galaxies contain a [[Black Hole#Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH)]] as their galactic nucleus, surrounded by the [[#Galactic Bulge]].

## Galactic Bulge

A galactic bulge is a tightly packed group of stars within the [[#Galactic Center]] containing the galactic nucleus. Some have a spheroidal structure and some have an oblate sub-structure called the **Galactic Bar** within the bulge.

> [!measure] Typical Parameters
> - Mass: $M_{\rm bulge} \simeq 1.067 \times 10^{10} \; {\rm M_{\odot}}$
> - Scale Radius: $b \sim 0.3 \;{\rm kpc}$

**Composition:**
- Old, metal-poor stars ([[Stellar Populations#Population II (Pop. II)]])
	- Metallicities of $z\sim 10^{-2}-10^{-3}$
	- Less orderly Orbits (e.g. not in same direction as disk, more eccentric, etc.)
- [[Stellar Clusters#Globular Cluster|Globular Clusters]] ($\sim 10^6$ stars each)
- The Galactic Nucleus, which maybe a [[Black Hole#Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH)|SMBH]] and/or may act as an [[Black Hole#Active Galactic Nuclei|Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)|AGN]]
	- For the [[Galaxies - General#The Milky Way|Milky Way]], the galactic nucleus is [[Black Hole#Sagittarius A*]].

## Galactic Disk

The galactic disk can be broken down into two regions - the inner [[#Thin Disk]] and the outer [[#Thick Disk]] -  in which the spiral arms extends (in a [[Galaxy Classification#Spiral Galaxy]]). 

### Thin Disk

> [!measure] Typical Parameters
> - Mass: $M_{\rm disk} = M_{\rm thin} + M_{\rm thick} \simeq 3.944 \times 10^{10} \; {\rm M_{\odot}}$
> - Scale Radius: $r_{\rm thin\ disk} \simeq 5.3 \; {\rm kpc}$ 
> - Scale Height: $z_{\rm thin\ disk} \simeq 0.25 \; {\rm kpc}$

**Structure:**
- Contains a majority of the Milky Way's stars, gas, and dust, and can exhibit spiral structure (except in [[Galaxy Classification#Lenticular Galaxy|lenticular galaxies]]) and/or barred structure (hypothesized to be a recurrent dynamical feature while in the disk phase).

**Age:**
- Stellar population is typically younger (less than 10 billion years old) and more metal-rich. ([[Stellar Populations#Population I (Pop. I)]])

**Motion:**
- More circular stellar orbits (mostly) confined to the plane of the disk.

**Origin:**
- Believed to be formed from the collapse of a gas cloud that was enriched with heavy elements from previous generations of stars.

### Thick Disk

> [!measure] Typical Parameters
> - Mass: $M_{\rm disk} = M_{\rm thin} + M_{\rm thick} \simeq 3.944 \times 10^{10} \; {\rm M_{\odot}}$
> - Scale Radius: $r_{\rm thin\ disk} \simeq 2.6 \; {\rm kpc}$ 
> - Scale Height: $z_{\rm thin\ disk} \simeq 0.8 \; {\rm kpc}$

**Structure:**
- Thicker and more spheroidal in shape. Diameter is about half that of the thin disk.

**Age:**
- Stellar population is typically older (more than 10 billion years old) and more metal-poor. ([[Stellar Populations#Population II (Pop. II)]]) 

**Motion:**
- More eccentric and inclined stellar orbits that are tilted with respect to the thin disk. 

**Origin:**
- Believed to be formed from the heating and thickening of the [[#thin disk]] due to interactions with other galaxies, mergers, or accretion events.

### Spiral Arms

The spiral arms are concentrations of the young stars in the galactic disk. The spiral arms form from a density wave moving through the disk *(see [[Question 114]])*. Due to the high mass density and the high rate of star formation, theses regions tend to be very bright and luminous.

*(Also see [[Galaxy Classification#Spiral Galaxy]])*

## Stellar Halo

The stellar halo is the luminous region surrounding the [[#Galactic Disk]], and is usually the region that defines the size of a galaxy, since we cannot observationally put good constraints on the dark matter halo size.

> [!measure] Typical Parameters
> - Mass: $M_{\rm stellar\ halo} \sim 10^{9} M_{\odot}$
> - Scale Radius: $R \sim 100 \; {\rm kpc}$

**Composition:**
- Old, metal poor stars ([[Stellar Populations#Population III (Pop. III)]])
	- Less orderly Orbits (not in same direction as disk, more eccentric)
- Contains remnants of minor satellite galaxy mergers (which has been used as a test of [[Dark Matter#LCDM]])

## Dark Matter Halo

A quasi-spherical distribution of dark matter, which can explain the flat rotation curves (circular velocity of stars as a function of radius) seen in galaxies (amongst other things, see [[Dark matter]] and [[#101|DM evidence]]). The dark matter halo is the dominant structure component for the galaxy at large scales.

> [!measure] Typical Parameters 
> - Mass: $M_{200c}^{\rm DM} \sim 10^{10} - 10^{13} \; {\rm M_{\odot}}$
> - Concentration: $C_{200c}^{\rm DM} \sim 0.1 - 50$
> - Approx. Radius: $\sim 200 \; {\rm kpc}$

**Composition:**
- Non-visible halo composed of dark matter.

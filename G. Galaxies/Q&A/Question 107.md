### Question

What is the morphology-density relation for galaxies? Give several possible explanations for this trend.

### Answer

The **Morphology-Density Relation** is an empirical trend between a galaxy's [[Galaxy Classification#Hubble Morphological Sequence|morphological types]] and the environment they are found in. It shows that...
- [[Galaxy Classification#Elliptical Galaxy|Elliptical]] and [[Galaxy Classification#Lenticular Galaxy|Lenticular]] galaxies are more likely to be found in denser environments, like [[Galaxy Group|galaxy groups]] and [[Galaxy Cluster|galaxy clusters]].
- Conversely, [[Galaxy Classification#Spiral Galaxy|Spiral]] galaxies are more likely to be found in less dense environments, like the field (i.e. isolation)

Illustrated below, where ${\rm S0}$ is another name for the [[Galaxy Classification#Lenticular Galaxy|lenticular galaxies]].

**Potential Explanations:**
Strong evidence suggest that star formation is suppressed when galaxies enter high density environments such a clusters. (not well understood)
- Denser environments lead to more galaxy mergers ("galaxy harassment"), [[Fluid Mechanics#Ram Pressure|ram pressure]] stripping, and galaxy strangulation
- These processes disrupt spiral structure formation, leading to higher populations of elliptical and lenticular galaxies (which tend to be more gas-poor) in these dense regions

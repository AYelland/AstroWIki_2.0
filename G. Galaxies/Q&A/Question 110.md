##### What is the "Tully-Fisher relation"? Derive this relation beginning with the virial theorem and using simplifying assumptions about galaxies.

![[Velocity Dispersion#Tully-Fisher Relation]]

##### How can this relation be used to determine H0?

Measuring the [[Hubble]] ($H_{0}$) requires knowing the distance ($d$) to an object and its recessional velocities ($v_{\rm rec}$). 

$$v_{\rm rec} = H_{0} d$$

Recession velocities can be found from the [[Redshift|redshift]] of the galaxy, measured through spectral shifts.

Distances can be found by the measuring the rotational velocity ($v_{\rm rot}$) of a galaxy through the [[Spectral Features|spectral]] line widths. Using the Tully-Fisher relation, we can determine the intrinsic [[Luminosity|luminosities]] and the associated observed [[Flux|flux]]. From the flux, we can determine the distance to the object.

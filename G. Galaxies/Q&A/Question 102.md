##### What are the typical mass ranges of dwarf galaxies, normal galaxies, and galaxy clusters?

The below diagram described the approximate mass ranges for [[Galaxies - General|galaxies]], [[Galaxy Group|galaxy groups]], and [[Galaxy Cluster|galaxy clusters]].

##### Describe a few ways in which we measure the masses of these different types of systems.

**[[Galaxy Classification#Dwarf Galaxy]] & [[Galaxy Classification|Normal Galaxies]]**:
   - [[Velocity Dispersion#Rotation Curve|Rotation Curves]] (see [[Question 101]])
   - Velocity Dispersion Methods (with [[Virial Theorem]])
	   - Spiral Galaxies: [[Velocity dispersion#Tully-Fisher Relation]] ($L \propto v_{\rm c}^{4}$) + assume $M/L \propto {\rm constant}$
	   - Elliptical Galaxies: [[Velocity dispersion#Faber-Jackson relation|Faber-Jackson]] ($L \propto \sigma^{4}$) + assume $M/L \propto {\rm constant}$
   - Dynamical masses obtained for example by [[Instruments#GAIA]] [[Stellar Clusters#Globular Cluster|globular cluster]] motions.

**[[Galaxy Group|Galaxy Groups]]**:
- Luminosity mass
- Scaling the galaxy mass for the number of number of galaxies in a given group ($N \sim 10 -50$)

**[[Galaxy Cluster|Galaxy Clusters]]**
   - [[Gravitational Lensing#Weak Lensing]] for total mass measurements (can strong lensing also constrain mass?)
   - Scaling relations from X-ray measurements (see Geoffrey's notes 165) or [[Cosmic Microwave Background#Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect|SZ-effect]] measurements
   - Assume [[Stellar Structure#Hydrostatic Equilibrium|hydrostatic equilibrium]] of the [[Intracuster Medium|ICM]]. Then we can obtain the mass through measurements of density and temperature, both from X-ray and emissivity.

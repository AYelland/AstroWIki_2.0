### Answer

##### How many globular clusters does our Galaxy contain?

[[Galaxies - General#The Milky Way]] contains $\gtrsim 150$ [[Stellar Clusters#Globular Cluster|globular clusters]].

##### How are they distributed in space?

Distributed (roughly) isotropically in the [[Anatomy of a Galaxy#Stellar Halo]] (i.e. not in the disk), but potentially an oblate/flattened distribution rather than perfectly isotropic. About $\sim 1/3$ of the distribution is closer to the [[Anatomy of a Galaxy#Galactic Center]] (within $\sim 40 \; {\rm kpc}$, Megan's Notes).

##### What fraction of the total mass of the Galaxy do they contain?

Globular clusters make up about $1 \%$ of the mass in the stellar halo, and $0.01 \%$ of the total galactic mass.

##### Why do some galaxies have prominent spiral structure and others do not?

If we tried to explain the existence of spiral structures with differential rotation, then we find that structure dissolves too quickly as the arms wind up tighter and tighter, the so-called "[winding problem](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/w/Winding+Problem#:~:text=The%20simplest%20idea%20for%20the,because%20galaxies%20exhibit%20differential%20rotation.)".

> Meaning, spiral arms would have wound up ~10s to 100s of times in the age of the universe ($\sim 13.7 \; {\rm Gyr}$). In such a case, we should not see prevalent structure today, as it would all be washed out over many rotations.

##### Briefly describe the density wave theory of spiral structure

The **density wave theory** describes the spiral structure is a density wave that moves through the disk, causing the stars and gas to clump up along the wave fronts (similar to how sound waves move in air).

As gas clouds enter the spiral arms, they get compressed by the increased mass density and trigger an increased star formation. Then as the time passes, only the long-lived stars with higher angular velocities can escape the density wave, giving rise to stars outside of the arms.

> [!bonus]- Why does the density wave appear in the first place?
> The clumping for matter in the disk is related to magnetic buoyancy. These same spiral features will arise in any disk-like system where magnetic field lines are [[Question 95|frozen in]].

> - Like a bubble in water, the underdense region will be pushed out along the path of least resistance (out of disk or out of arm)
> - Since the magnetic field lines are frozen into the material, the field lines are bent. They then are kept from bending further due to magnetic tension, preventing material from going too far.

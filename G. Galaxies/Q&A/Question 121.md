### Question
---
What fractions of each of the following is composed of "dark matter": (i) The solar neighborhood, (ii) a typical galaxy like the Milky Way, (iii) a typical galaxy cluster like the Coma cluster, (iv) The universe. How are each of these estimates arrived at?

### Answer
---
Fractions for all but the last one are relative to matter only. 

##### (i) The solar neighborhood

$$f_{DM} \lesssim 20\%$$

Within the [[Galaxies - General#The Milky Way|Milky Way]] disk (and therefore in the [[Sun|solar]] neighborhood), we expect to find little [[Dark Matter|DM]] because DM is not thought to be dissipative. Therefore, it will not collapse into a disk like baryonic matter does. 

The number quoted above is estimated based on [[Instruments#GAIA]] stellar kinematics ([source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.03103.pdf) from Katelin Schutz, former MIT student).

##### (ii) A typical galaxy like the Milky Way

$$f_{DM} \simeq 90-95\%$$

We can estimate the total mass in a galaxy from [[#101|rotation curves]] or [[Velocity dispersion#Velocity dispersion|velocity dispersions]] profiles. From this, we can infer a total DM mass by comparing to stellar contributions through a mass-light ratio and our knowledge of stellar evolution (basically, adding up all the stars masses via their light). 

For more sophisticated analysis, we can incorporate other factors (like anisotropy) through a [[Jeans Formalism|Jean's analysis]].

##### (iii) A typical galaxy cluster like the Coma cluster

$$f_{DM} \simeq 90\%$$

Total mass of a cluster can be estimated from [[Gravitational Lensing#Weak Lensing|weak lensing]] or scaling relations (such as how the net result of the [SZ-effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunyaev%E2%80%93Zeldovich_effect) is proportional to cluster mass). 

We can then estimate the baryonic contribution from...
- the [[Electromagnetic Spectrum|x-ray]] emission of the [[Intracuster Medium|ICM]], assuming $\rho_{\rm gas} \sim \rho_{\rm baryonic}$.
- the [[Velocity Dispersion#Cluster Velocity Dispersion|velocity dispersion]] of galaxies in the cluster, such that we can use the mass-light ratio (originally done by Zwicky in 1930s for the [[Galaxy Cluster#Coma Cluster]]). Turns out we need a very large mass-light ratio $\implies$ lots of dark matter.

##### (iv) The universe

$$f_{DM} \simeq 30\% \text{ of the net energy density}$$
 
Constraints from [[Cosmic Microwave Background#Power Spectrum|CMB power spectrum]], [[Baryon Acoustic Oscillations|BAO]], and BBN can give relative abundances of dark matter and baryonic matter $\Omega_m\simeq 0.3$ and $\Omega_b\simeq 0.02$ (see [[Instruments#Planck]])

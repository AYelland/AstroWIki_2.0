##### What is the “Faber-Jackson relation” for elliptical galaxies?

![[Velocity Dispersion#Faber-Jackson Relation]]

##### How is this different than the "fundamental plane" for elliptical galaxies?

Large scatter in the Faber-Jackson relationship for different types of population lead to the development of the "fundamental plane" which incorporates a 3rd independent parameter $R_e$ called the "effective radius". FJ is then a projection of this relationship down the $R_e$ axis.

The [[Velocity Dispersion#Faber-Jackson Relation]] has a large scatter ($L-\sigma$ plot) for different types of populations (ranges of galaxy luminosities), where the power ($\gamma$) is dependent on the data fitted. This lead to the development of the "fundamental plane", which incorporates a third independent parameter called the "effective radius" ($R_{e}$). 

$$\text{Fundamental Plane:} \hspace{2cm} L^{\alpha} \; R_{e}^{\beta} \; \sigma^\gamma \propto \text{const}$$

The [[Velocity Dispersion#Faber-Jackson Relation]] is then a projection of this plane onto the $R_e$ axis, where $\alpha=1$, $\beta=0$, and $\gamma=\tfrac{1}{4}$ .

What is two-body relaxation? For a self-gravitating cluster of  objects, each of mass , with a velocity dispersion , what is the relaxation time? How long does it take for a massive object ($M \gg m$) to sink to the bottom of a cluster potential well?

![[Timescales#Two-Body Relaxation]]

##### How long does it take for a massive object ($M \gg m$) to sink to the bottom of a cluster potential well?

The massive object, mostly unaffected by the smaller masses, will sink to the bottom of the potential well roughly on the [[Timescales#Dynamical Timescale|dynamical/free-fall timescale]].

$$t_{\rm ff} \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{G \rho}} \; \propto N\hWhere \rho = m n = \frac{3 N m}{4 \pi R^{3}} = \frac{3 v^{3}}{4 \pi G^{3} N^{2} m^{2}}$$

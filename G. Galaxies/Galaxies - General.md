> [!definiton]
> A galaxy is a gravitationally bound collection of gas, dust, and stars with a total mass $\sim 10^{6} - 10^{13} \; M_{\odot}$ . 
> - Its the $4^{\rm rd}$ largest gravitationally-bound structure in the universe, following [[Galaxy Group|galaxy groups]], [[Galaxy Cluster|galaxy clusters]],  and cosmic filaments. 
>   - There are many subclasses of galaxies that span wide range of masses, morphologies and chemical compositions. 
>   - It's thought that all galaxies have a [[Black Hole#Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH)]] in the [[Anatomy of a Galaxy#Galactic Center]], but there are functioning models without a central [[Black Hole|black hole]] that seem to some galaxies as well (e.g. NGC 1277).

## Examples

### The Milky Way
*(Abbrev. as **MW**)*

> [!measure] Parameters
> - Mass: $M \sim 10^{11} \; {\rm M_{\odot}}$
> - Rotational Velocity: $v_{\rm rot} \sim 200 \; {\rm km/s}$

### Andromeda
*(Commonly known as **M31** or **NGC 224**)*

**Information:**
- Found originally in the [[Catalogs#M|Messier]] and [[Catalogs#NGC|NGC]] catalogs.
- Barred spiral galaxy in the andromeda constellation
- Largest member of the [[Galaxy Group#Local Group]]. 
- Moving *toward* the solar system at a speed of $\sim300\,\pu{km s^{-1}}$

> [!measure] Parameters
> - Mass: $M \sim 10^{12} \; {\rm M_\odot}$
> - Radius: $R \sim 50 \; {\rm kpc}$
> - Distance: $D \sim 800 \; {\rm kpc} \sim 1 \; {\rm Mpc}$

### Large Magellanic Cloud
*(Abbrev. as **LMC**)*

**Information:**
- A satellite galaxy of the [[#Milky Way]]
- The third closest satellite galaxy 
	- (except maybe its the closest because are the other two considered to be disrupted? See [[Galaxy Group#Local Group]])

> [!measure] Parameters
> - Mass: $M \sim 1.4 \times 10^{11} \; {\rm M_\odot}$ (of which $10^{10} \; {\rm M_\odot}$ is baryonic)
> - Radius: $R \sim 10 \; {\rm kpc}$
> - Distance: $D \sim 50 \; {\rm kpc}$

### Small Magellanic Cloud
*(Abbrev. as **SMC**)*

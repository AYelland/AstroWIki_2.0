A gravitationally bound collection of (typically) 50 or fewer galaxies, each at least as luminous as the Milky Way (~$10^{10}\, L_\odot$). Galaxy groups are smaller than a [[#Galaxy cluster|galactic cluster]]. [[Galaxies - General#The Milky Way]] is part of a galaxy group called the [[#Local Group]].

> [!measure] Typical Parameters

**Subtypes of Groups:**
- Compact Groups 
	- a compact group consisting of a small number of galaxies ($\sim 5$) in close proximity and relatively isolated from other galaxies and formations.
- Fossil Groups 
	- the end-result of galaxy merging within a normal galaxy group, leaving behind the X-ray halo of the progenitor group.
- Proto-groups 
	- groups that are in the process of formation, and basically a smaller form of protoclusters.


The first discovered galaxy group was Stephan's Quintet:

## Local Group

The [[Galaxy Group|galaxy group]] containing about 100 galaxies, including our own [[Galaxies - General#The Milky Way|Milky Way]].

> [!measure] Properties
> - Number of Galaxies: $N \lesssim 100$ (mostly faint [[Galaxy Classification#Dwarf Galaxy|dwarf galaxies]])
> - Mass: $M \sim 2 \times 10^{12} \; {\rm M_{\odot}}$ (mostly in MW and M31)
> - Diameter: $D \sim 3 \; {\rm Mpc}$ ($\sim 750 \; {\rm kpc}$ between MW and M31)

The **major components** of the Local Group include (by order of mass)...
1. [[Galaxies - General#Andromeda|Andromeda (M31)]]
	- Future merger with Milky Way in $\sim 4 \; {\rm Gyr}$
	- Moving towards each other at $v_{\rm rel} \sim 120 \; {\rm km/s}$
2. [[Galaxies - General#The Milky Way]]
3. Triangulum (M33) 
	- satellite of Andromeda
4. The [[Galaxies - General#Large Magellanic Cloud|LMC]] and [[Galaxies - General#Small Magellanic Cloud|SMC]]
5. Many [[Galaxy Classification#Dwarf Galaxy|Dwarf Galaxies]]

##### Describe a sequence of observations to identify an exoplanet, to determine that it has a rocky composition, and to measure the chemical constituents of its atmosphere.

***The Steps to Identifying an Exoplanet:***

1. Discovery.
	- Likely to be discovered by [[Detection Methods#Transit Method|transits]], but it could be through [[Detection Methods|other methods]]
		- Determine planet's radius ($R_{p}$) and period ($P$) (see [[Question 8#What can one directly determine from this measurement?|8]])
		- The radius may or may not include the atmosphere, depending on wavelength of observation and atmospheric composition.
		- With spectroscopic follow-up, can determine the [[Bonus#Bonus - Measuring the Planet's Temperature|planet's temperature]]
2. [[Detection Methods#Radial Velocity Method|Radial velocity measurements]] will constrain the planet's mass ($M_{\rm p}$), if $v_{\rm r,*} \gtrsim 0.1 \; {\rm m/s}$. (see [[Question 8#What additional observations are needed to determine the mass of this planet?|8]], [[Question 9|9]]) 
3. Compare mass-radius relationship to determine composition.
	- $M_p$ and $R_p$ gives an estimate of the density. Higher density (lower radius for a given mass) means rockier planet.
	- There [[exoplanet_compositions.jpg|exist some constraints]] for mass-radius relationships for planets of different composition. (Sarah Seager has worked on this)

4. Analyze atmosphere through transmission spectroscopy.
	- For the atmosphere, look for absorption features imprinted on the spectrum during a transit.
	- This allows us to infer the chemical composition of the atmosphere

##### What have we learned about exoplanet interiors and atmospheres from these observations?

- High level of diversity in exoplanet composition and properties
- Have observed...
	- [[Planetary Classes#Hot Jupiters]] with opaque clouds
	- Inflated  [[Planetary Classes#Hot Jupiters]] with larger radii than expected.
	- Planets with and without thermal inversions
- With transit spectra, the exoplanet atmospheres can include: $\ce{H_{2}O , CO , NH_{4} , CH_{3} , HCN , \dots}$

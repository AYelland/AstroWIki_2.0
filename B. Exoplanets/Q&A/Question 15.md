##### Why are M Dwarfs thought to be promising candidates for identifying Earth-sized, temperate planets?

[[Stellar classes#Red Dwarf|M Dwarfs]] (also known as **Red Dwarfs**) are low mass and low luminosity stars that make detection of low-mass, temperate, Earth-like planets easier because:

1. The low-mass of the [[Stellar classes#Red Dwarf|M Dwarfs]]  leads to larger radial velocity anomalies of the star (induced by the planet)
	- An Earth-sized planet around a Sun-like star does lead to measurable [[Detection Methods#Radial Velocity Method|RV effects]]
	- From [[Question 8]], the half-amplitude of the radial velocity anomaly is $v_{*,r} \propto M_*^{-2/3}$. Meaning, if the star is smaller, it can more influenced by the planet and the radial velocity anomaly is larger.
3. The "habitable zone" around a [[Stellar classes#Red Dwarf|M Dwarf]] will be closer to the star (than for a Sun-Like star - [[Mnemonics#Spectral Classification - Sun|G2V]]) due to the lower luminosity. 
	- "habitable zone" - the radial zone around a star where the temperature is suitable for life
	- The habitable zone is around  $\sim 0.1 \; {\rm AU}$ for [[Stellar Classes#Red Dwarf|M Dwarfs]].
	- Since both radial velocity and transit methods are biased toward planets with close orbits to their host star, we expect [[Stellar classes#Red Dwarf#M Dwarfs]] to be promising candidates to find habitable-zone planets.
5. [[Stellar classes#Red Dwarf#M Dwarfs]] are the most abundant type of [[Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram#Main Sequence (MS)|main sequence]] star ($\sim 75 \%$ of all stars in Milky Way)

##### Why aren't these planets likely to be habitable?

- The habitable zone is close enough to the star that the planets are likely to be [[Planetary Migration#Tidal Locking|tidally locked]].
	- With one side in perpetual daylight and the other in eternal night, there would be extreme temperature variations from one side of the planet to the other
	- This could lead to the perpetual night zone being cold enough to freeze the main gases of their atmospheres, leaving the daylight zone bare and dry. (a thick atmosphere or ocean could combat this through heat circulation)
	- Difficult for life to form in these conditions (at least similar to Earth)
- M-dwarfs have a lot of stellar activity
	- Stellar flares, strong magnetic fields, and eruptive surface activity
	- The activity can strip nearby planets of their atmospheres very quickly
	- High stellar radiation is dangerous for life. The Earth's magnetosphere and atmosphere protects us from a lot of deadly solar radiation.

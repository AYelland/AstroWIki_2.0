This is an Obsidian Vault (https://obsidian.md/) composed of notes to help fellow MIT Astrophysics graduate students study for the Astro Oral Qualification Exam.

The published version of these notes can be found at: https://publish.obsidian.md/astrowiki

That said, it is easier to navigate and study the notes by downloading the Obsidian Application to your local computer alongwith a copy of this GitHub repository.
